<h2> Similarity Profiles: Finding archetypes and outliers </h2>

---
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p> These charts were made from evaluating which players had similar production on the basketball court and what that production looked like as a profile. The statistical categories were all counting stats as recorded by basketball reference and normalized to counts per 36 (referred as per36). Similarity scores were generated by using a euclidean distance metric to other players' statistical profiles. The top 5 closest players were gathered for the graphs below. The shown statistical profiles were reduced to the main basketball stats (points/rebounds/assists/steals/blocks) with an addition of 2-pointers and 3-pointeres made. Statistical profiles were filtered through a 44 game minimum filter and then percentiled against other players. </p>

 <h3> Brook Lopez: Well-rounded offense, Defensive anchor </h3>

<p> It is not a mistake that Milwaukee has the league's leading defense. Having Giannis being a wrecking ball on offense and defense certainly helps but Brook Lopez is not a slouch on either side of the court. He is able to produce around the league median of counting stats and is one of the elite blockers of the league. Similar players include other versatile centers highly valued around the league: Myles Turner on the Pacers and Jonanthan Isaac on the Magic. </p>

<h3> Dejounte Murray: Defensive guard with questionable shooting </h3>

<p> Dejounte Murray and other players found to be similar to him certainly fit a mold. They're mainly known as guards with elite defense and produce their points by driving to the basket. They have higher than median rates of generating points and their rate of making 2-point shots is well above the league but are well in the cellar regarding 3-point shots. These guards generally rebound much more than the average guard and produce great-to-elite steal numbers. As mainly perimeter defenders, they don't generate much in the way of blocks which the chart reflects. </p>

<h3> Torrey Craig: Defensive wings unite </h3>

<p> Torrey Craig seems to fit the profile of players known as wings whose job is to lock down the opposition and generally stay out of the way on offense. If they do generate points it's mainly through 3-point shots. They all have a decent rate of generating rebounds but are not elite. Of the various profiles I generated, this is one of the closer cluster of profiles, their similarity scores all being less than 0.2 (as seen in other profiles, scores are generally above that mark). </p>
