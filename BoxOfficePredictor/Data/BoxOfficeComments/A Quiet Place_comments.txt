I enjoyed the teaser a bit more, but this movie still looks awesome. 
Alright gang, I did an *extremely excessive* amount of sleuthing since I had a boatload of free time, so here's everything I was able to pick out from the various articles and notes in the opening moments of the trailer (not counting the 5 second preview), and my interpretations:

**Shot 1:**

* The multiple TV screens depict (L-R/U-D): someone (perhaps a newsman) wearing kevlar and talking as what appears to be a tank rolls by in the background, static, something emitting smoke, soldiers exiting a transport helicopter, a car on fire, more static, SMPTE color bars (albeit in black in white), people walking calmly down the street alongside a row of cars stuck in traffic, and a crowd frantically running through the streets as papers fly all around and a loose traffic light swings in the foreground. Interpret any of those as you will.

* The creatures are definitely pack hunters, and at least 5 of them are dogging the writers of the whiteboard note (presumably our protagonists)

* As speculated previously, the creatures are blind, and attack anything that makes a sound, as the whiteboard confirms.

* As of thus, the creatures' weakness is unknown, as are their motivations (the whiteboard questions whether they have any demands).

* The whiteboard reads, "WHY DON'T THEY ---T THEIR KILL." The covered word is short enough to presume that it says eat - which suggests that the creatures are simply killing for sport rather than eating (which raises another question - what do they eat, if anything? How do they stay alive?)

* A headline reads, "Death Angels: Reign of Destruction." Not sure what this implies about how humans saw the creatures before society's downfall, but it definitely further confirms that the terror they invoked was widespread.

* Another whiteboard has a list of cities along with corresponding timestamps in military time: "London - 19:49; Bogota - 19:52; Moscow - 19:54; Boston - 19:58." Below is a stickie note that simply reads, "NO PATTERN." This could suggest a lot of things, but the most likely explanation is that somehow, the creatures emerged worldwide on the course of the same day, attacking major population centers within minutes of one another (the timestamps are presumably recorded as they occurred by an observer in one standard time zone). As to how the creatures emerged almost simultaneously and pulled off a worldwide invasion within likely the span of an hour is unknown, but it makes sense for them to target huge cities first - massive populations generate massive noise pollution.

**Shot 2:**

* The biggest whopping big newspaper headline announces that the U.S. military as a whole has been defeated: "We can no longer protect you." Womp womp.

* Interesting detail: a partial headline reads: "------------ IN/OUT CLOSED --------- POWER OUTAGES." Its subheading: "Magnetic Pulses Cripple Wall Street As Financial District's Hard Drives are Wiped." This is huge, because it's the first evidence of the creatures behaving in ways that exceed animalistic hunting, as well as revealing the ability to generate EMP pulses, I would imagine similarly to the MUTOs in the 2014 *Godzilla*. The mention of drives being wiped also sounds similar to the blackout event mentioned in *Blade Runner 2049*. But beyond that, this is only further confirmation that the creatures hunting our protagonists are likely just the mop-up crew; humanity's downfall at the creatures' hands was most likely an organized assault not just on individuals and cities, but on human society as a whole, crippling the world in more ways than one. This can only mean that the creatures are more than just monsters, but are also sentient complex thinkers, which would suggest a more extraterrestrial origin. Or, y'know, maybe I'm just reading into this too much.
(Also: the article text is difficult to decipher due to YouTube compression, but I was able to partly make out the photo's caption, which mentions that a number of people are still missing, that number being in the double digits, and that among the missing are children).

* A cut-off headline reads: "Refug------------ Admi------------ To -------." This is just a guess, but most likely tons of people were labeled as refugees if they lived in countries overrun by the creatures, and many of them tried to flee to safe countries, but were denied admittance. Makes sense, and feels topical.

**Shot 3:**

* "Joint Chiefs: 'Not bullets, not bombs! Armor is impenetrable!'" Again, the creatures' weakness remains totally unknown, and the total lack of effectiveness of the military's primary weapons is probably what led them to give up. It also means these creatures are even harder to kill than initially conceived.

* The TV screen's caption is partly cut off, but what's readable says, "------E - NO.93 DEVASTATES PERU," along with footage of something in ruin (hard to tell what). There are a lot of possible interpretations here, but it could be that after the initial attack, the creatures continued to retreat and then again assault major population centers, or perhaps the headline states that the creatures are landing in Peru for the first time, the 93rd attack by them. I don't know for sure.

* Another newspaper headline: "'NO CHOICE' BUT FORCE DECLARES PRESIDENT." This headline is probably from earlier in the creatures' invasion, when the military first begins their fruitless attacks on the creatures.

* There is a huge article that appears to be simply names of people, listed in no particular order it would seem, but the big "Bronx" subheading suggests these are people from New York who have disappeared, organized by borough. That, coupled with the Wall Street headline from Shot 2 (which had a picture of a suspension bridge, whose caption mentioned missing people), seems to suggest that New York was one of the first cities hit, and possibly one of the hardest hit.

* Partly hidden behind a newspaper image is a map, with Boardman Bridge and Wellsville labeled. As it happens, Wellsville is a street (avenue, technically) that is nearby the Old Boardman Bridge - the Google Maps image looks almost identical to the map in the trailer when looking at rivers and streets. The bridge, and thereby the location the map depicts, is in New Milford, Connecticut. Could this be where our story takes place? I also considered the possibility that the Old Boardman Bridge is the bridge our protagonists cross in the trailer, but pictures of the bridge have a number of differences.

* The top of a headline reads, "THEY CANNOT," and again features news on more happenings in New York, but more interestingly, it is the first headline visible to have a partial date - a Friday in November. This connects with another date as seen in...

**Shot 4:**

* We see the front page of what appears to be an issue of the San Francisco Chronicle ("The Largest Daily Circulation in Northern California"). The headline is partly cut off, but the small holes are easy to fill in: "SHANGHAI DEATH TOLL IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS." These are just the *confirmed deaths* imagine all the injured and unconfirmed deaths. But beyond that, the front page date is clearly visible: Tuesday, November 27 2018. *Uh-oh.* This also corresponds with the November date on the paper in Shot 3, a Friday, which could potentially be the 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, or the 30th - all Fridays perfectly corresponding to November 2018. So the downfall of humanity is definitely in swing by at least November 2018 in this film's world. As for how long afterwards our story takes place, who knows.

**Shot 5:**

* Just Emily Blunt. Nothing to scrutinize here, but Emily Blunt is never *not* worth mentioning.

**Shot 6:**

* A play-by-play of what occurs on the screen, most likely amidst a creature attack: chaos in the streets. A man in a suit runs by, the walls in the background have graffiti. There's a piece of furniture, and what appears to be a water bottle standing upright (someone must've made a flip so perfect that everyone vowed not to disturb it). Way more people fly on-screen, running through streets that are covered in rubble, maybe from the buildings around them? A utility pole lies on top of an overturned car, which in turn lies on top of *another* rightside-up car, with rubble all around/on them. Many more people keep running by. Then the screen cuts to static.

**Shot 7:**

***P A R A M O U N T : A VIACOM COMPANY***

That's all I've got. I think I've managed to piece a few puzzles together. Or maybe I just did a bunch on incoherent rambling. Sound off if you have thoughts.
These trailers are like really intense versions of AMC Theaters' old **SILENCE IS GOLDEN** bumpers.
Interesting, they're being hunted by blind creatures that kill for sport according to the whiteboard in the trailer. Excited to see how this turns out.
Humanity would lose in *seconds*.

Nice try holding your breath while running, Big Tuna.
You know, normally, I find pregnant women in horror movies to be, well, sort of like low hanging fruit. Here, however, it makes it much worse...because damn, you have to make noise giving birth. I don't care how strong you think you are, it's just going to happen.
Big Tuna? Quiet Tuna Now.
Is knocking up a chick really the best thing to do when you are supposed to stay silent and humanity is in ruins?
This looks good but does anyone else wonder why the kid was allowed to have a toy that makes obnoxious noises to begin with? Wouldn't you have at least taken the batteries out?
[deleted]
Was that [cross on the bridge](#spoiler) a spoiler?
If what's hunting them doesn't turn out to be an army of Dwight Shrutes I'm going to be disappointed. 
They could have kept [the giving birth scene? I think](#spoiler) a secret as that looks like such a tense scene in the theatre. 

Still really excited for this one though. Hope Jimbo kills it. 
My guess is they will have slits for eyes and no nose, but a big mouth and jaw, just like every other monster that's been made since the LOTR cave troll.
Plot-Twist: This is Cloverfield 6, and Overlord is still Cloverfield 4. It’s so intense, it skips over the other two.
Wish they didnt show the birth scene, otherwise im HYPED.
So if you pause on the newspapers at the start it says that the american army has been defeated and that weapons guns/bombs don't work on them ... but these guys carry and point guns ... I am confused, as it just seems like something that would just cause more noise. 
Glad to see this looks like a straight-forward monster movie and isn’t a case of “the monsters were us the whole time” like “It Comes at Night”
http://i.imgur.com/QONVIyz.gif


one word: FARTS!
Hmmmm... Reminds me of the book Birdbox, only this time people are required to stay quiet.
Nature makes so much more noise than a creaking floorboard.
The Date on the newspaper in the beginning says November 27, 2018!! NEAR FUTURE!
I am so in on this movie.  I can't tell you the last original film that was marketed in a way that was so appealing to me.
[deleted]
This looks Excellent. I hope the movie lives up to what this trailer is showing here.
This movie is going to keep a lot of people on edge. Looks brilliant! 
I'm betting right now, that infant and the deaf girl will be the only survivors.
this looks great
I could totally survive in this world  [](/fluttershh)
Really like the concept, I think this is going to be pretty enjoyable. Seems like the monsters have a really cool design and aren't exactly paranormal, which is awesome.
need2see
Bat monster? 

Makes sense, they use echolocation to hunt and in the trailer you see a furry top half and a bat like claw hand maybe
Weird that they use “The Med Bay” from Alien: Covenant in this
Can I enter my upstairs neighbors as extras in this movie?
So is this finally the trailer that shows too much of it?
From the trailer, here I thought [they weren't going to talk for the whole movie and it was about the family being deaf](#spoiler).... Oh well...
Reminds me of Tremors 

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100814/
i think it looks so cool but i just can't get past the hump that is Krasinski directing. his track record isn't exactly promising. 
Coming from someone who's really interested in what the hell these creatures are and their backgrounds, I really appreciate this comment. 
This should have been cloverfirld 3 haha.
Well done man
Hey everyone! Thanks for the feedback and thoughts! Also, thanks to a 4K upload of the trailer, I've traced a few more interesting tidbits and stuff I missed for you guys, because I have nothing better to do. Tried editing the original post but it would seem I've exceeded my character limit (*phew*), so putting my findings here instead. Shall we?

* In Shot 1, the unknown object emitting smoke turns out to be *the street itself in flames.*

* In Shot 1, the "Death Angels" article is hung up twice, as well as a different one reading, "MILITARY EXPERTS A----- (agree?) - DARK ANGELS INDESTRUCTIBLE." Another cut-off headline mentions a national emergency of some kind. Clearly.

* In Shot 2, I was able to read a good chunk of the blackout article thanks to increased clarity, and it turns out it doesn't relate to its headline at all, but does hold a couple of curious statements. An aircraft has gone missing - MH370, a commercial flight with 238 passengers and crew - not sure how that fits in. Then it suddenly switches gears to talk about nationwide *meteor impacts* (perhaps how the creatures get to Earth?), resulting in unrecoverable bodies - 3 corpses found, but 30 people still missing, including 15 children, and recovery efforts continuing after 6 days. Curiously, the article refers to the meteor strikes as massive tragic *attacks*, rather than wild accidents. It later mentions another recovery effort lasting 8 months (perhaps for the missing plane) before a memorial is made on a site.

* In Shot 3, I hadn't noticed before, but the image on the "armor is impenetrable!" headline actually features a somewhat decent outline of the creatures, albeit shrouded in smoke. Its clawed hand, as featured prominently toward the end of the trailer, is the most visible part of its body in the image, and it appears to have some sort of spike-like protrusions on its... Neck? I guess? It's definitely bigger than humans, I would guess maybe 10 feet tall if not larger, and at least in the image, it seems to be grounded rather than airborne.

* In Shot 3, a mostly hidden picture/article showcases a massive crowd, and among the few visible words of the article are "procl---" (proclaim?), "the bible," and "missions." I guess that aspect of society probably had a nervous meltdown after a while as well.

* In Shot 3, the article above the No Choice But Force one mentions national guard and FEMA efforts to help displaced citizens, mostly in New York, and it's *bad*. National Guard announced that 30,000 people need shelter - 9,000 of which are holed up in a convention center in Pleasantville with a capacity of 5,000. The article again mentions the meteor strikes - possibly the reason for displacement, and why rubble is seen frequently in the TV screens. About 45,000 temporary housing units are planned to be set up in New York, but the national guard said it might take a while. *Yikes.*

* In Shot 3, the No Choice But Force article goes into further detail, with the top U.S. military commander deciding to deploy one of the largest conventional bombs used in combat against the creatures, weighing in at 21,600 lbs/9797 kg (*goddamn*). Apparently it was dropped somewhere on the border of Connecticut and (presumably) New York, where "unknown invaders" were residing, which further backs up that our story probably takes place somewhere in the former. Apart from casualties being built up from the blasts, the article mentions a heavy sonic attack that knocked out electricity and water, making people even more fearful. This could very well easily have been from the blasts, but considering how the presence of the creatures affects electricity later in the trailer, other possibilities remain open. Speaking of...

* In Shot 6, that lamp to the left of the screen is flickering pretty erratically. Could be just loose wires, but it also might not bode well...
Good work.

One thought:  Nuke's cause EMPs.  Maybe we nuked ourselves as a last ditch effort?
Heres something interesting. Death Angels really stuck out to me as the most specific description of these things we've got, which isnt saying much. Anyway I searched angel of death and it came up with results for Samael, turns out in Gnosticism, Samael means "The Blind God" His appearance is that of a lion faced serpent. Food for thought. 
It kinda reminds me of the future predators from Primeval. Sensitive to sound, hell, they're even blind, and are said to be the eventual cause of humanity's extinction.
You deserve to get paid for this
Is this written for blind people? If so, thats truly generous of you. Good job.
i wouldn’t say the creatures are “definitely” pack hunters since “Attack in pack?” is circled and on the side of the whiteboard labeled “questions” rather than “confirmed.” 

not doubting that they are, just saying that nothing in that shot confirms that they definitely are pack hunters. it confirms that none of the characters even know for sure.
A copy and paste off the internet but I found this interesting:

Psychopomps (from the Greek word ψυχοπομπός, psuchopompos, literally meaning the "guide of souls” are creatures, spirits, angels, or deities in many religions whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls from Earth to the afterlife. Their role is not to judge the deceased, but simply to provide safe passage. Appearing frequently on funerary art, psychopomps have been depicted at different times and in different cultures as anthropomorphic entities, horses, deer, dogs, whip-poor-wills, ravens, crows, owls, sparrows and cuckoos. When seen as birds, they are often seen in huge masses, waiting outside the home of the dying.
haha oh god i just spit soda out my nose imagining sitting down for a movie and this trailer plays, the characters all sorts of traumatized and tortured, we the audience are all horrified, kids are screaming, mothers fainting, then

**SILENCE IS GOLDEN**
The whiteboard just says on that subject “why don’t they eat their kill”, someone who read the spec script (which John Krasinski rewrote heavily apparently) told me what they are and details on their methods. I wonder if John changed that. The shot of Emily looking at the screens with the whiteboards visible also show multiple newspaper clippings, two speak of Death Angels, a third one of Dark Angels, indestructible? 

I’ve been wondering why that name specifically, two redditors told me what they heard the creatures are and it contradicts the spec script, but some elements (the name, and them being blind) fit with that, the “demands?” part however does not. Demands can only imply, indeed, sentient beings 
I read that real fast and at first read it as: "Hannity would lose in seconds." As in Sean Hannity.

Probably still true haha.
Not to mention the fact that babies tend to be very loud. 
I was thinking the same thing, that's a great situation to set up with these constraints. 
Tuna, check it out. You, me, this weekend, cabin in the woods. Monsters: scary, Emily Blunt: hot. SoCo, noisy space shuttle, sand on the floor, boot, rally, *more* SoCo, then back to my place for a quick nap and we hunt some monsters at a fireworks show. 
Canned Tuna LOL XD
When that chick looks like Emily Blunt and she's his wife, the dude gets a big time pass.
People were speculating that the parents prob didn’t know the kid had it/found it.
Have you tried taking batteries out of those darn toys?! Suckers are screwed and glued on.
>rummaging through town for supplies

>kid finds cool toy he's not allowed to have

>hides it from parents

>decides to walk a little behind on the walk back so he can play with it

>sound activates

Kinda easy to piece together
Why do you assume that the kid was allowed to have it?
could be like a 'sound grenade' as well, if the child is in danger throw it as distraction 
So are they actually creatures or is it a lame twist? If they're monsters are they cool or just humanoids? 
Got a link to it?
Can I have the link to the script as well please? 
hey send it to me too while youre at it
May I please get one too? I need to make sure a certain someone in my life will be able to see it with me
[You see him at the beginning of the trailer and then never again, so...](#spoiler)
Yeah, pretty sure we can all guess what happens. But why didn't they take the batteries out of that toy? 
Snowmen.
the first trailer had that scene in it as well
Your spoiler tag is broken
I was thinking the same thing! I doubt it’ll ruin the movie but I had no idea that was a thing until I watched this trailer. That said it makes that whole scene look even more creepy. Like how in the hell can you be quiet during something like that?
i'd guess it's early in the movie. maybe even very beginning and how one of the kids was born.
it's a natural product of CGI limitations. The less 'angles' the better. The 'shinier' the better. So everything is a slimy and curvy without the facial features CGI doesn't do well. Definitely takes me out of a movie when I'm like 'oh look, turns out the monster was actually this film's budget the whole time'
Or like the stranger things monsters. God those are boring as fuck.
Don't forget the gigantic ears for hearing all the things.
ILM is behind the VFX, so it should at the very least look good, I’m sure they’ll keep it concealed as much as possible 
i wish they just dont show them..
I don't know, I think it makes it a lot more suspenseful. I mean, giving birth sucks enough. You practically have to make some noise during it. 
Yea, especially since IMDb has "newborn baby" in the cast so most likely she survives this scene as well does the baby.
maybe stuns them/ knocks them out
Having a choice in an invasion, I'd definitely bring a gun even if it's next to useless. If bullets don't do anything, hey look, you have a club that goes boom too. Plus seeing daddy with a shotgun probably puts the kids at ease.
> and that weapons guns/bombs don't work on them

Which is always the case in monster flicks, because plausibility requires it, as frustrating as it may get.
It actually doesn't say exactly what the bullets and bombs don't work on. 
God that fucked me off. I saw the first trailer, then stayed away from all marketing in case it was spoiled. Should have just read the wiki instead of watching the film.
I'm more annoyed that I have to read about it in every trailer thread..
I believe they do that know cause there was a study saying a lot of people lose interest in trailer within the first few seconds. 
I was told that by two people but I’m unsure. I don’t know where you see a furry top half exactly ? The original script: not bats, much more conventional but since John rewrote it, you never know 
Wouldn't work with the concept, if the monsters track people via sound, since if they were deaf they wouldn't know when they made a sound.
The family daughter is deaf, it's why they know ASL
[deleted]
Oh boy weren't you wrong.
maybe it is, in the universe
Also the Christmas lights you see outside flicker. I'm guessing they set them up as a kind of alarm since they flicker when the creatures are near. 
The film was shot in upstate New York, I’m guessing they might actually set it there 
At the end of the trailer when you see it's hand, the lights are flickering which makes me think it's related to the creatures. Not to mention they habe strewn together Christmas lights probably as a warning system
Lizard people
Just watched a clip of this show on YouTube, think I might give it a watch.
Pm me monster details. 
I would also like to know monster details. 
Monster details?
Well he definitely can't shut the fuck up, so I don't like his chances. 
it's gonna be a still birth, end up saving her ass or some shit
No.  I don’t want to do any of that.
Thank you for this
The Full Metal Bitch is the exception to every rule.
but not a condom.
That makes the most sense. The boy is shown to be following the quiet rule just like the rest of his family so he probably didn't know the toy would make those noises too.
That's true, and as a father of a 3 year old I can say that for whatever god damn reason the batteries in these types of toys are nearly *eternal.* 
In the trailers he played with it twice.  
[deleted]
A disclaimer: Folks who read the spec script have said that . based on the footage we have, John has heavily rewritten it. He did his own draft 
[deleted]
care to share?
The kid found it probably.
It wasn’t as obvious that she was pregnant in that one though. Just your basic close-up scream face shot.

This one makes more sense and will add way more tension.
Yes but we didnt know she was pregnant until right now
I don't think so. The spider crap monsters in Maze Runner weren't cheap to generate, but their faces were a [total derivative of the cave troll look.] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mazerunner/images/4/4c/Griever-maze-runner9.jpg)

Also, these monsters must always follow the same cave troll convention that they scream off the top of their lungs at their prey, which goes counter to every ambush predator instinct there is, but the makers think this scares the 8-year olds in the audience (even the 8-year olds think it's bullshit grandstanding by the monsters).

If possible, the noseless monster should hunch down and hold their arms out to the sides when screaming, and then stand back again, [as if they are belting out a song on American Idol.] (https://www.destructoid.com//ul/471647-/Dr2-noscale.jpg) Yeah, that's scary.
Or just zoom in and have most of the creature/monster/robot's body hanging off the screen and just show, like, a leg. Like they did in Transformers. 
I liked season 1's monster. But yeah, the "demidogs" were pretty uninspired in my opinion.
The S.T. monster pissed me off so much. An intelligent ambush predator that captures its prey and slowly sucks them dry of energy; yes! Lets have it scream like a super-furious elephant bull, that's scary, very tactical, and also logical!

Do lions hate and despise gazelles, and roar at them while stalking them?

The S.T. monster should have been just voicelessly breathing, maybe cooing in anticipation, like the super-creepy animated Gollum in Ralph Bakhsi's 1977 LOTR version, crazier than a bag of kittens.

If your phone rings at 4 in the morning, what would be worse for you to hear? A loud voice screaming "Aaaargh! Fuuuuck! God damn it!"? Or a very faint, hushed giggling, and then a continued wet mouthbreathing? And you hear from the sound aspect that the breather is smiling, because you can tell. Rounded vs unrounded lip sound.
Bonus: [latest bullshit monster,] (https://youtu.be/4yX0bZMZq3Y) at the end of this upcoming square enix game. Devs are so phoning the entire enemy ensemble in, with disposable and non-red-bleeding, non-relatable enemies. As codified by the [harmless, shitty Chitauri.] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelmovies/images/6/67/Chitauri-Avengers.png)
Which movie monsters have had that? Cave troll had no ears. Nor the cloverfield monster, who is also in the club.
Here's to hoping it will become a classic.
The Langolier conundrum. Good point. :)
And what do you do with the screaming infant???
Imdb cast lists are notoriously unreliable. Ask all the GoT fans who lost their shit when Benjen Stark would show up in the list for years on end. 
Best case scenario stun ok, but guns are loud...would just attract more
Yeah, I know the guns won't do anything, but I'd still want it.
[deleted]
Nah, it's for YouTube. They put something interesting in the first five second to hopefully engage people into watching the full trailer before skipping the ad
It's way more interesting for non-hearing impaired people to be forced into silence
absolutely agreed, but the director has plenty of clout. but hey, maybe this is a turning point for him. 
i’d say half wrong. the movie is not without problems but overall yeah he did a great job. 
The bridge where Krasinski is running is New Paltz
It's pretty damn good. I wouldn't really recommend the spin-off, Primeval New World though. It's pretty sub-par.
I’m speculating that kid with toy is dead. Early on. Or flashback. The rest of the trailer it’s mainly the two other kids. The little girl is walking and John Krasinski is carrying the other kiddo. I can’t think of any other scene where I see 3 kids. 
Problem was the kid was still playing with it when it was clearly making noise. I think realistically, the kid would have tried to stop it, dropped it, or throw it to the side the moment it started doing it or when the father started charging right at him.
Its so kids can't get to them and swallow them.
Same scene both times.
Thanks for the response! I'm on my phone now and can't remember the spoiler tag format so I'll have to shoot you a couple of more questions tomorrow, if you don't mind.
may I as well?
Can i get one too?
Can I have it too?
Sorry to ask, but I really want to read it
Can I have one too?
Can you PM me too?
May I as well?
Scary...
I wonder if they're going to do the MASH thing and suffocate the baby.
Trolls aren't ambush predators. 
Season 1's monster was just a demidog standing up, lol. It was just as bad.
The "roar before attacking" cliche is one of the worst monster/animal cliches in movies. 
To be fair this isn't a SE game, they're just spotlighting it.
It would be unusual, but I'm just making a prediction based on the trailer showing that they hear very well.
You're telling me [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3NyvZ61-Hqk/UK-wHz_jaXI/AAAAAAAABXo/YMoiC48U8cI/s1600/Screen+shot+2012-11-23+at+11.51.58+AM.png) doesn't look good??
Nothing, there's nothing you can do. Babies are simply going to cry. You can lock it up somewhere and it the things don't hear it, but it will be literally years before that child is old enough to understand that it has to be quiet for its very survival. 
Do what they did in the VVitch
If they are so sensitive to sound then maybe firing off a shotgun in an enclosed space really fucks them up for a while, allowing you to run for it.

Would explain the firework scene too, set them off and the creatures cannot focus on just you.

last resort lol 
Yet it’s true 
Where's the ad, though? There wasn't an ad to skip. Even if there was an ad, wouldn't it be *before* the trailer and *before* the five second teaser? The five second teaser seems to be a part of the trailer, not a part of an ad if there was one.
clout.
Don't they also show a cross in pretty much the same place in the first trailer?
edit: [yep](https://youtu.be/p9wE8dyzEJE?t=19s)
Maybe the kid is deaf and it'll be some kind of plot point?
Huh, I thought he starts playing with it while they were walking past a small town.
To quote Dustin “demodog”
I mean...so they probably have to...ya know...
bingo 
They use this trailer before other videos as an ad.
The trailer it's the ad. 
clout
There’s our emotional investment hook!
he doesn’t make it. First trailer shows the deaf daughter visiting a cross on the bridge (where he stood), and there are only two kids in the house in the footage 
Would explain why they all know sign language as demonstrated by the supper scene.
Millicent Simmonds the girl actress is deaf irl so that explains why they all know sign language. The kid has it. 
We both know what they have to do. 
Why would you use two different words to describe the same thing? You say "watching the full trailer before skipping the ad" as if YouTube isn't wildly known to have ads play in front of trailers?
nothin to grab your emotions like slaughtering a 6 year old
My assumption was the sign language is for survival.
Pennywise knows this too.
Millicent Simmonds the little girl actress is deaf irl so good on them for actually casting a deaf actor in a deaf role.
