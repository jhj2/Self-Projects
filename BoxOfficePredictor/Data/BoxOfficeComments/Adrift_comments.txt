I am surprisingly interested
This reminded of of JC Chandor's [*All is Lost*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017038) starring Robert Redford (and no one else). 
I liked Everest enough, and this looks pretty good. I wonder how much of the based on a true story thing is really in there.
This looks really good.  
This looks pretty intense. The trailer actually managed to get me invested in the characters. Though the fact that it's based on the "incredible true story" makes me think they definitely survive

Anyway, I'm interested in this film, hopefully I get a chance to see it.

this trailer had a trailer for itself at the beginning. 
Shailene Woodley is auto-watch. Only bit me in the ass with Divergent. Other than that I've ended up enjoying everything she picks. Even White Bird in a Blizzard.
The trailer shows way too much but it does look pretty good, the script apparently got a lot of praise. 
Annnnddd, I've seen the whole movie.
So I guess I've seen the movie now.
>Q. Did anyone ever suggest that you receive counseling to deal with your trauma?

>A. No one ever suggested it, but I wish I had because I definitely had some severe post-traumatic stress syndrome. I really wish I had taken the time to do that. I'm fairly headstrong, so I'm always, `Oh, I can get through this on my own.' Now looking back, at times I really needed some professional help.

>Q. What was the hardest part of your ordeal?

>A. Definitely the hardest part was dealing with Richard being gone. There were times I didn't even want to live anymore because I didn't know how I was going to go on. I was never going to fall in love again.

>But, actually, while I was in the survival mode, the grief was fairly low. It wasn't as intense as when I got to shore and the survival was over, and I could see people together and everything kept reminding me of him. I just really had a hard time. But that survival instinct [while at sea] just kicked in. It helped me to focus, to keep myself on track.

"Based on the incredible true story" - Gamephysics tsunami in the next shots. Ok. Next trailer.
I’m in. 
I really like this film .very beautiful story.
I dunno, that really didn't do anything for me.  You basically know the entire story now, and since its based on a true story you know at least 1 of them is going to make it back alive. So you'll have the standard love story, before at least an hour of movie screaming and suffering before they find land/safety again.   
  
These kind of movies just don't get me excited, so I guess I am not the demographic for this. Doesnt look like it required a huge budget though, so it could easily make a good profit from a smaller release   
  
*edit: downvoted for sharing my opinion lol.  This trailer has 75 points after 11 hours on reddit - i'm clearly not the only one who didn't love the trailer*
This does look like an interesting watch, and I like Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin (haven't seen a lot of his work, but he was so charming in the Hunger Games movies).
Looks beautifully shot with terrible writing. I swear the amount of times I've heard "You can do anything you put your mind to"
awesome! I was trying to recollect the name of a VR game I saw couple of months back and here we are.

cool trailer though.
Baltasar Kormákur is a good director so I'm in. 
I swear I've heard the theme before. Anyone know where it's from?
"Based on the incredible true story..."

...and I'm out.
Surprised they didn't mention shleine woodley in the entire trailer.. guess she isn't as big as she could've been.
I'm kind of really liking the way this was shot. And the score at the end feels really powerful. And the fact that the movie feels like it's about surviving a lot more than just the hurricane storm has me invested.
Me too. I imagine it will be as bad as Everest so worth maybe one watch to see if they achieve any kind of story telling.
And a shipping container.
Kormakur also directed this: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764275 

Also in the sea though probably not as much.
Actually, this whole story appears like it could be some bullshit. In reality, the male half of this duo was swept out to sea and died, but here they simply made him injured so they could keep the love story going. 

Here's the female survivor's actual account: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-03-19/features/0303180492_1_sailing-cabin-south-pacific
Posting to reddit seems a lot like surfing, in the sense that you have catch the wave at the right moment before you start paddling.
They all do these days. It's the new normal.
Really enjoyed her performance in Big Little Lies.
Well you didn't see the part where they get razzed up by a Kaiju, and this is actually a prequel to Pacific Rim.
They haven't shown the tiger yet. Just you wait.
[Not impossible.](http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/monster-waves-vessel-measures-record-ocean-swells-a-408953.html)
Survival isn’t necessary for a true story. **Open Water** is based on a true story, and the ending isn’t exactly happy. 
At 2:10, her and then the other dudes name too. Gotta pay attention
Hey...I liked Everest
Everest was not a bad film.


[Plot tiwst: He became a halucination of her's when he went missing.](#spoiler)

Just a wild guess going off when was said in the trailer but I fully expect it to be true after thinking about it. 


Well, he clearly said, "and after a few days, there are hallucinations." You should probably watch the movie before you call the story bullshit.
Great way to put it! 
It was quite bad.
In the interview posted above, the woman says that her "innerspirit" "spoke" to her to keep her alive. Definitely will be portrayed by force ghost fiance. 
Yeah I'm a 100% sure this is what happens. It would be really weird and stupid for a movie in 2018 based on the incredible survival of a women to change the story so much and [keep the male character alive even though he died](#spoiler)
So glad they put that in the trailer.
Fucking nailed it. Hated this movie.
Well shit. You may well be right about that. 
How so?
Well they didn't have a problem changing the category of the hurricane and calling it the "largest storm in the pacific"*

*of that season.
Reporting in, go see it its not cliche
