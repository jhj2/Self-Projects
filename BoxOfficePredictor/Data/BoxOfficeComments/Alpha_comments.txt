*Based on a true story.*
This looks like it could be slightly better than I think it will be. If that makes sense. Like it looks like its gonna be bad, with good visuals....but I just get some kind of feeling that it will be slightly better than my brain says its going to be. 
Xbox Or Playstation? It didn't say.
An origin story for dogs?!
Wow. A big budget March release that isn't existing IP and doesn't have huge stars. I'm impressed.
I'm going to see this at the drive-in theater so I can bring my dog along. 
You just know him and his dog mate are going to run into another pack of wolves and they will try fight him and his dog mate will stick up for him after nearly joining them. 
Good doggo.
Saw this before Justice League and was surprised that I had not heard of it yet. The trailer was great in IMAX. Iâ€™m excited to see this.
Holy fucking shit. I expected nothing at all for the first dozen seconds of this trailer, and am now pretty hyped to go and see it. An interesting original story with a completely unknown cast and crew and a relatively large budget? I'il watch it.
Looks fresh and new, but trailers have lied to me before.....
Looks good.  Great reminder of how small steps lead to giant leaps for species.
I won't be seeing this until I see a page for it on that "Does the dog die?" website. I can't handle that stuff anymore.
It's the beautiful people version of "Quest for Fire".
This has been being advertised for a while. I will check this out. It could be fun.
