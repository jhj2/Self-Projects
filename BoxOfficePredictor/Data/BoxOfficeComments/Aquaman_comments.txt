Calling it now, the training scene on the beach is going to start with him as a kid and when he catches the spear in his hands he's a teenager.  
*DC’s hottest new movie is *Aquaman*. This trailer’s got everything: Undersea gladiators, a shirtless Polynesian, fish people riding armored sharks, Nicole Kidman. Be sure to check out Black Manta, a giant ant from outer space who, if you ask nicely, will shoot you with his face lasers from the deck of his pirate submarine.*
The Black Manta costume design is pretty bad ass
Is it weird that the most surprising thing to me was the fully white title card? It looks great, it just hasn't been done very often in superhero films. Which isn't something one would ever think about. 
Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy unite!
holy shit. a comic accurate black manta suit that actually fires lazers.

take my money.
Atlantis looks like an underwater Wakanda. 
when Aquaman watches Bane crash a plane with no survivors, he says "my plan!"
My man! 
STATUS OF THE RIDE: AINT OVER YET
It looks great but all the dialogue seemed really cringey and cliche. Hopefully it's just the trailer and it's better in context. But it does look fun!
Black manta looks fucking insane 
Why hasn't anyone compared Atlantis to the Gungan city on Naboo from The Phantom Menace yet?!
This is a lot more colourful than I was expecting. I like it.

I'm glad that it looks like DC's finally embracing the silliness of their properties. With the right care, it could be an interesting contrast between the pseudo-realism of the MCU, and the more wacky but unrealistic DCEU.
Vinny Chase is looking good! 
This looks fucking insane. It's like a space opera but in the ocean.

A *sea* opera, if you will
Aquaman looks nothing like either of his parents. 
Mera looks hot holy shit
Redheads amirite? 😉 
THE TRENCH! That was an awesome shot. Black Manta looking great too.
Jesus Christ, that's a ***lot*** of make-up and prosthetic on Aquaman.

You can barely tell that it's Vincent Chase. 
I never in my life thought I’d be so freaking excited to see a movie starring Aquaman... but here I am!
Holy shit Warner Bros went 3/3 today on trailers. 
Looks pretty good but boy the CGI on that shark in the aquarium is awful
DC going 2/2 with trailers today
The CGI... looks really off? I guess they got time, still.

Atlantis looks nice. The rest is very fake. Scene on a pier needs CGI, why? 
Manta looking gangsta af
Atlantis looks FUCKING AMAZING
Some of that CGI is not good 
Little disappointed in the CGI quality, especially with the shark in the aquarium scene.  But hopefully they'll brush it up when it hits theaters.

Movie looks ok, though I think thats partly because Im more hyped for the Shazam movie
That CGI...oof 
This looks like nothing I have ever seen and that excited me so much. Black manta looks great too!
Holy comic book accuracy!
My body is ready
SHARKS WITH MOTHERFUCKING LASERS HELL YEAH
Redheads, you gotta love 'em!
I’ll be honest...I don’t think it looks that great. Did it look kinda off to anyone else? I’ll still probably see it but it looks like more of the same DC movie crap. 
[deleted]
Not exactly as excited as I wanted to be. Dialogue seems a little clunky and generic, but Atlantis looks gorgeous and I like the costumes. Compared to the Shazam trailer, which made Shazam one of my most anticipated upcoming movies, I’m a little disappointed. Here’s hoping the actual movie is great tho! 
Is it just me or does he throw out a "chee hoo" right at the end there?
Two DC Trailers today with kids getting bully-pushed...glad we could check that box.
All the crazy things going on in that trailer and the most distracting thing is Mera's hair.
Eh...I loved some of the visuals toward the end; on the other hand, stuff like the aquarium scene looks *really* cheesy. 

And speaking of cheesy, anyone else still not a fan of Momoa's Aquaman? It's like everything I used to dislike about Dwayne Johnson just transferred over to Jason Momoa, all those "dude-bro" vibes. It worked as a nice juxtaposition to everyone else in Justice League (one of the few things that *did* work in that film), but this just made him seem...I'm going to stick with cheesy. I suppose the rather formulaic plot doesn't help, either. 

I'm going to see it regardless, but this trailer left me very whelmed overall. (Besides Black Manta, holy farts he looks cool!!) 
This looks like a mess, and after reading the comments on here I feel like i'm taking crazy pills.  
I'm so fucking happy with how Black Manta looks y'all don't even know
That shot with Black Manta shooting the lasers sold the movie for me
The shot of the fans looking at each other and then cheering was so fucking epic for some reason. Also the shot of Aquaman and Mera jumping down into the ocean with the red flare whilst all those creatures chase them was pretty sick too.
This looks pretty terrible to me? 

Some of the costumes and sets look cool, but the dialogue is awful, the CGI looks straight out of 2002, and Momoa and Heard don’t appear to have unearthed any hidden acting talent for this.
I think this will be the greatest superhero film ever. 
Wasn't really sold on any of the stuff at the beginning, but the rest looks pretty solid. Atlantis especially looks awesome. I will stay cautiously optimistic.
James Wan has me optimistic but I didn’t love the trailer. Mainly the dialogue. It looks great visually though, hoping it’s good. 
Well, at least Shazam looks good...

The CG in this so unbelievable bad, and Jason Mamoa is just miscast as hell.  He looks the part, but half the dialog is horribly written or acted.
'stopping sharp objects from hitting you in the face with your bare hands' the movie
Is it just me, or do the visuals look AWFUL. Like, the CG looks incredibly dated. It doesn't just look like CG, but like CG from 15 years ago.

Also, what little acting you see sounds incredibly stilted.

>Redheads, you gotta love em.

...ok that I can get behind.
Loving the Green Lantern-caliber CGI lmao
I can’t be the only one that thinks this movie looks terrible. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills. 
Is it just me or this trailer's seemed very fast? Like I was checking if the video was playing at 1.25x speed.
I'm getting Valerian/Jupiter Ascending vibes from this.
Black Manta. OH MY
I feel like I'm missing out on some very elaborate reddit inside joke where everybody thinks this looks good??? It looks incredibly generic  AT BEST, the sharks reminded me of the one in Jaws, dialogue is as corny as ever
Looks like crap... are you people serious with these reactions? It looks just as generic and uninspired as the previous DCEU films.
The CGI in the aquarium scene looks terrible 
I can't be the only one who thinks this looked so freaking crowded and terrible? I get that its James Wan but my flipping goodness does this just look like a Fast and the Furious movie. I'm not going to rush out to watch it.

Does this move have its own soundtrack? Thats the music from Batman v Superman (or at least from the Ultimate Edition trailer).
"Redheads... you gotta love 'em!" 



I do hope this and Shazam will give DC a good name. 
At what point do we actually stop calling her Mera and start calling her Ariel?
RemindMe! December 21st, 2018
Oh yes, the Wonder Woman treatment. 
That's when you need to put yourself to the test  
And show us a passage of time  
We're gonna need a montage

Ah yes, the infamous Indiana Jones transition with the hat.

Looks like they used Disney's approach through and through.

In other news, Director of films involving a talking Racoon and a sentient tree and golden people, James Gunn has been fired.

Honestly if it were'nt for Comics already, we'd never get these crazy, impossible sounding films.
High quality Stefan
Thank you, Stephan
Like he was ripped out of the comics. So good. 
I wish it were a bit more skintight like the classic suit instead of the modern armored 'Iron Man' design, but I'm glad it still looks like iconic Black Manta and not some modernized version (ex: a guy in a black shirt with red swimming goggles) 
He looks like a dick. Might just be me. 
I always thought he'd be hard to make work with that unruly helmet. But damned if they didn't nail him.
>The Black Manta ~~costume design~~ is pretty bad ass


It surprised me too. But it felt so refreshing! 
IDK what it is but man it was amazing!

Has an avatar and lord of the rings vibe to it!
White title card?
we will get a post credit scene with aqualad in it guaranteed 
CREATURES OF THE DEEP ASSEMBLE!!!!
That's Mera. More like Mermaid Man and Barnacle Bae.
[deleted]
But does he have sharks with lasers attached to their fricken heads?
Atlantis forever!
wetkanda forever
Give this man a snorkel
This kinda reminds me of Black Panther with the whole challenge for the throne angle, also
Hopefully it’ll be shown more than a 10 second intro scene.
got a lot of black panther vibes from the trailer/storyline tbh, which isn't necessarily a bad thing just hope the story stands out more than it currently seems to
Hopefully with better CGI
looks like the gungan home world from Phantom Menace
when Aquaman reaches the surface and is exposed to the sun he says "my tan!"
When Aquaman found out James Wan was directing his movie, he said “My Wan!” 
He's a big guy... 
When shitposters posts memes on /r/movies, aquaman says, “Here’s a ban!”
When you ask Aquaman why it's so cold he says "my fan"!
When Aquaman finds out his contacts work with his special eyes, he says “my brand!”
Ride ain't over!
MY MAN!
My man!
Looking good! 
dressed like a Fish
Yeah!
Dressed like a manta.  I dig it.
MY MAN!
**YEAYUH**
Lol “Permission to come aboard”.  Why do writers always try to write  these “clever” one liners. The “clever” one liner followed by grin is a big cliche now a days. Especially in super hero movies. 
Wan's Furious 7 had a lot of cringey dialogues.

But they worked well for the tone of the movie, hope it's the same case here.
All of DC's movies have been like that. It's like they are the /r/FellowKids of the movie world.
Your half-brother Orm, who you presumably never knew about, since I felt the need to tell you what his relationship to you is, is up to no good.
Yeah, I was kinda getting Green Lantern (2011) vibes from this trailer.
Aquaman sure does love screaming wooohooo
"redheads, gotta love em" AMIRIGHT? HAR HAR HAR
That's because Mamoa is a shitty actor who gets by on being the almost always silent Khal Drogo. He can't deliver anything without sounding awkward. 
I just finished watching Justice League. Some of the cringiest dialogue came from Aquaman. Doesn't give me high hopes for the movie, a big CGI fest with no lasting impact.
Yeah visually it is cool, but Momoa came across the same way for me in Justice League.  Too bad.
They showed more footage to us at Hall H. A lot more Black Manta. A bit of an extended chase scene on the rooftops.
That fucking mask off though.
Because Black Panther came out more recently and the trailer feels a lot like BP. What with the fantastical city, the royal hero, the literal fight for the throne.. etc...
There’s always a bigger fish. 
Because when I think about that I remember Jar Jar Binks, and my mind reflexively recoils in disgust.
Tis a hidden city!
Now we just need them to let Henry Cavill shine in a new Supes (Man of Tomorrow) and I will be forever content
I don't think its a DC thing to be so dark as much as a Snyder thing. The dark knight movies were dark because it was batman and Nolan understood the source material. Not sure why the Man of steel movie had to be so dark though, its like Krypton had literally never heard of a color that wasn't grey or black.

Like Themyscira was pretty colorful in wonder woman, even the war had alot of colors in it. 
I hope DC goes as full blown comic accurate as possible. I definitely prefer that as a fan.

These are larger than life characters. Even the non powered people like the bat family and green arrow clan. Make larger than life movies. 
So cheerful, you sure you're not from the Marvel universe?
> This is a lot more colourful than I was expecting. I like it.

Multiple DC execs rubbing their hands right now.
> and the more wacky but unrealistic DCEU

First time I've hear the DCEU referred to as wacky
>I'm glad that it looks like DC's finally embracing the silliness of their properties. 

100% agree. DC is usually more silly than Marvel in it's comics, embracing it's Golden Age Heritage and all that. So glad they are using that instead of trying to make all heroes Batman.
I hate the circumstances that pulled him out, but I'm glad Snyder is gone
Came here for this
Tell Sloan I said "what up?"
Still can't believe he turned down Aquaman 2.
Took way too long to find a vinny chase comment
Sea Wars
Now we just need the Green Lantern space opera 
That made my pupils dilate so wide. I would honestly love it if Wonder Woman, Shazam and Aquaman become the new trio and take the DCEU to a new level.
[deleted]
You just know that if this film is actually really good and really successful than some stupid ass studio like Sony is going to take the wrong message and think "underwater movies are the new space movies. We have to get our slice of this as soon as possible" and try to make their own over the top, retro cheesy, colorful ocean based movie that will end up as one of the most hilariously terrible movies ever made.
I'm really not buying this comment. The special effects look mediocre, the dialogue was cringe, and the plot seems cliched as hell. Sensing some shilling in this thread.
Maybe we’d all look like Aquaman if we worked out a lot and grew that hair. 
Quick question from a non-comic reader:  
Is Aquaman’s mother’s name Martha?
That's Amber Heard for you
She looks like the Mary Jane everyone wanted on the big screen.
Redheads, you gotta love 'em.
She’s got a little mermaid thing going on
Seriously though
[deleted]
I do like how comic booky Mera's shade of red is.
She’s gorgeous, awfull wig though.
When i was a kid Ariel gave me a thing for redheads, and now Mera is just reaffirming that. (damn redheaded mermaids)

(Barbara Gordon from batman the animated series also did that for me)
Came here for the Vinny Chase references. Was shocked to find it so far down. 
I've been waiting all my life. 
I DEMAND AN ORANGE SUIT
so far trusting in James Wan has not felt like a let down
Wish they could have got James Cameron to direct it though. 
They have a long way to go to top James Cameron’s original masterpiece
4/4. New Fantastic Beasts too. 
I'm trying to catch up on all the comic con trailers, what are the other two?
There was so much cgi and none of it looked particularly good to me. The dialogue was pretty lame at times too. Kinda confused by all the praise in these comments.
and on the bit with the crowd cheering.
That fucking Trident shot. Holy shit that looks bad. They couldn't have made a prop?
The trailers are never the problem really.
That shark at the beginning looked awful.
It reminds me of a lot of Chinese blockbuster movies with the weird CGI
I've felt outside of Man of Steel most of the DC movies have a had shoddy CGI.
Reminds of Pandora from Avatar a bit. 
Yeah it looks incredible. I just consider the glimpse we saw in Justice League the rough concept version. This is the *true* Atlantis 
It could be DC's Asgard.
You must be referring to the part in the trailer.
I would say most of it
That shark in the aquarium. Eeeeeee. 
Aquaman > Black Manta
Really?  It looks like everything I've seen.  Main character struggles to be who he's destined to be, bad guy has giant CGI army, origin story to explain main character's back story, and giant CGI city hidden to the rest of the world.
I'm so wet. 
freaking laser beams on their head
Ariel
Yeah I agree! The dialogue was kind of cheesy to me and I felt maybe they showed to much...I kind of felt like I saw the whole storyline.

I’m really looking forward to it still and plan on seeing it in theatres but it didn’t seem any better than any other DC movie put out. 
[deleted]
The cgi didn't look that good to me. We are 5 months out though. 
Agreed. I thought the Shazam! teaser was much more interesting.
It is a fact that you can tell how ‘bad ass’ and ‘awesome’ the content of the movie is based on the amount of times characters stop to say that it is ‘bad ass’ and ‘awesome.’

Personally, I don’t think anything looks really original.  Atlantis looks like generic CGI city, the plot seems to be the generic ‘I’m no hero/king/savior’ trope, and the bad guy look like the usual leader of giant CGI army.  That people seem to like the costume design.  My guess is that the movie will be average unless you are already a big Aqua Man fan, which will make it more enjoyable.
It was colourful, but that's about it. Did not make me interested in the movie, to be honest.
Definitely rolled my eyes when it showed him getting bullied as a kid. Everything about this trailer screamed cliche to me 
Agree. Compared to Shazam this trailer looked really generic.. 
I was kind of hoping they would deviate a bit from Aquaman's "Yeahhh!/My man" etc. in Justice League but some of the dialogue feels like they are keeping it up. Hopefully his character is shown to be much more than that.
The dialogue seemed really, really bad. I feel the same, plus a lot of the CGI looked bad. 
I can't figure out why it looks so bad. Did they maybe digitally recolour her hair (or wig in some shots) in post or something? 
Yeah, other than the CGI the acting from almost everyone seems subpar as well. Jason Momoa and Amber Heard seem very wooden. And that dialogue was pretty bad as well.
Yeah, I enjoyed the Shazam trailer, but this... 
You're not crazy. This is generic crap. We all remember the good trailer, crap movie formula that has described the DC movieverse experience. 

This is blatant astroturfing.

It’s your time. 
You are my king.
Patrick Wilson looks like a character from a PS3 game, why does his face look like it's CG
Especially right after watching the Shazam trailer. That seemed actually fresh, fun, and set in a tangible world. This trailer just couldn't compare
yeah amazed people are excited it looks rough 
Oh man, the dialogue made me physically cringe. “Permission to come aboard” in particular. The cgi is not great, and they are leaning hard on it. I like Jason Momoa and was hoping this would be good, but I don’t think it will be. People will still see it, though, no doubt. 
Aside from Wonder Woman, I don't get how they haven't figured out how to make decent movies out of their properties. They just keep making the same mistakes over and over again.
People jumping on the hype train so they can be disappointed again. I think you could remove Aquaman and insert any super hero into these scenes and they would fit.

This looks in-line with the other DC movies, Shazam looks like the first one where they're changing things up.
Believe me, if I'm right, I'll be returning to this thread as well lol   
  
I don't want to edit my post so I can prove it but what I mean is that he's a kid when the spear is thrown and when it whip pans to him catching it, he's suddenly a teenager.  One of those moves.

Some comedians turn into very good actors as they mature. Imagine if Bill Hader starts winning Oscars in 20 years, and then some whippersnapper digs up a Stefon clip on his AmazonMicrosoftAramco device.
This is why I fucking love comic books.
Turns out, the comics might know exactly what they're doing
The CW will take care of that soon enough

Like a nice glass of water, right?
> Has an avatar and lord of the rings vibe to it!

James Cameron's probably thinking: I need to step up my game for my underwater Avatar movie...
When the title is displayed, I mean. The background is white instead of black. It looks cool.
I'm hoping for Garth
Looks like a power rangers enemy 
Yahya looks more bad ass than Manta for me. That mask off.
He's the Alpha 5 I didn't know i wanted
ayy lmao
Too wide. Maybe if there were hoses or a "collar" for a thicker neck.

This isn't quite Funko bobblehead but if I wanted to insult it that is what I would use.
Black Manther. 
This deserves all the upboats.
We...we don't do that here
Like an inverse Black Panther, almost. 
Yup. Relatives fighting for the throne to a hidden kingdom and one of them wants to spread out and attack the outside world. Sounds a lot like *Black Panther* when you describe it in general terms.
They said around 3/4 of the movie is under water.
It seems to be a reverse of it though, Orm seems to be the King and Arthur is the challenger.
I mean this is the story in the comics.
Seems more like Thor to me. Very similar character personality to Chris Hemsworth's Thor as well.
Reminds me of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets
Some of Black Panther's CGI budget probably got handed to Infinity War
Yeah, glad I'm not the only one that noticed the CG needs work. Especially in the aquarium scene.
When Aquaman recieves a call from Batman, he says "Fuck Batman!"
For you
**UUUU**
> He's a big guy... 

Imagine if instead of Jorah, it had been Littlefinger who was exiled from Westeros and ended up in the khalasar with Khal Drogo and Daenerys!
When girls run upto Aquaman on land, he says "my fan!"
#MY MAN! 
I dig it. 
I dig it
SLOW DOWN! 
... and the bad guys always wait to hear the full line before they attack.
I was half expecting one of the submariners to say "We've got company" just before he came aboard.
Non-dorks are underrepresented in writers' rooms.
I think that's a kind of joke that deadpool or spider-man could get away with, because you know they'd be saying it in a joking tone, making fun of the clippy one liner cliche. 
He looked right at the camera, so I'm kind of 50/50 on that scene being a trailer-only one.
Honestly I didn't mind it but the way the two soldiers then looked at each other was painful. Hopefully that was only for the trailer.
Also those little quips need to be like 3 syllables max. Permission to come aboard is like .5 seconds of my life and it STILL drags. 
I do feel like Momoa!Aquaman would probably say it entirely because he'd find it cheesy
Nowadays? Did you watch any 80's or 90's action movies? Like... at all?
Every superhero movie writer wants to be making an Iron Man movie, it seems.
Don't know what this thread is on about, but this looks like the exact cookie cutter superhero movie that DC and Marvel (mostly Marvel) have been making forever. Marvel barely gets away with it at that. 
Oh man, if we get the equivalent of Dwayne Johnson popping his cast off with a “Daddy’s gotta go to work”... :/
But james wan didnt write either movie,.....so,...
This movie has a very different tone than Furious 7 from what we've seen. But I imagine it'll be fine
This should be upvoted more. Momma is stunning to looks at and I loved him as Drogo, but dude can’t deliver a line. Every time he opens his mouth he breaks character and ruins the scene. Did you see Conan? Jesus he was awful. 
It looked like the Fast Five roof chsse but with lasers.
Chase a chick, never chase a bitch
I got Thor vibes, especially when he’s like “I’m no king” or something along those lone
Weesa no liken outsiders.
Fuck that.  Give me an Archer movie starring Cavill in a black turtleneck.
Bingo. It was Snyder's vision. And while I'm not necessarily against a one off Superman movie that treats thing a little more "real", it's not the best tone for the DCU as a whole.
DC is darker than Marvel in the comics since the late 70s, but not as dark as Snyder made it to be.
> The dark knight movies were dark because it was batman and Nolan understood the source material.

Most importantly it was **just** Batman. Once you bring in other heroes, things have to change. Between this trailer and the one for Shazam, it looks like DC is finally figuring that out.
They'll have to include Aquaman's suit from the comics.
Not sure if anyone in the marvel universe is cheery these days after infinity war lol 
Sea Horse Wars
Or, since they're space cops, the superhero version of Hot Fuzz.
And Reeves Batman. Also a good Flash movie and a non-Snyder sequel to MOS. 

Forget Suicide Squad, Birds of Prey and all that, focus on your main heroes first and give us good films there.
It would be an interesting direction if the mythological/fantasy side of the DC universe came to the forefront, with gods, godesses, wizards, kings and monsters, at least for a while. It would be a fun contrast to Marvel's primarily sci-fi flavoured stories.
Yeah, I was watching at the beginning like "damn".

Then that shot of Atlantis appeared and my eyes went wide

Then we saw the ocean battles and I gasped

Then fucking Black Manta fired laser beams through buildings and my jaw dropped
Making a trinity movie with those three...I didn't even know I wanted to see that.
Twist! This is Earth-2, Darkseid invades and kills the big 3.
No but his Fathers name is Thomas,just like Batman's old man
CHEEEEEHUUU
damn you are fast
NOW you know why elon musk want to make that submarine.
How did they even make her more beautiful?
In some of the scenes the hair looked like a 2 dollar wig and in others it look like it was stripped off a real redhead 
I just like how comic booky she looks in general with her vivid green suit, rather than the faded colors that are normally used with superheros anymore.  
I would like it better if the wig didn't look so fake. The hair looked plastic-y in one of the scenes. 
I think this is great for comic book nerds familiar with it, but she looks so artificial to me
Seems more like dye.
The colour? I think it's on purpose - DC seems to be embracing the comic-booky side of the franchise.
It's July.  The kids don't know about Entourage.  
I was waiting for this and a modern Godzilla movie with all of the classic monsters since I was a kid.

Basically WB killed me today.

It's happening don't worry!!
SPOILER ALERT




We know it's definitely happening.

And him using dolphins and water skis!
I have never been a huge horror fan, but a big fan of James' cintematography and approach. 

Also he made a car jump skyscrapers which earns him lifetime props. 
lmao, good one that brings back memories.
Or at least bring back Vincent Chase or Jake Gyllenhaal.
It sounds like dialogue from a cheesy 80's b-list action movie.

"Permission to come aboard?"

"Badass!"

"We call it an ass-whoopin'."

"Redheads - You gotta love 'em!"
I was super disappointed by this too. The dialogue was so bad and the CGI and fights looked super weak. Even the wave going over the crowd before they sat back up looked weird. The praise is so strange and this feels really generic.

At least the Shazam trailer was amazing!
It really pales in comparison to the Shazam trailer imo. Like I can't help but groan at another DC movie where literally the fate of the entire world is at stake. 
This comments section makes me feel like a cynical bastard. The CGI looks gross, and this plot feels so generic. 
[deleted]
Releases like this, Reddit is absolutely inundated by the marketing department of the film. Come back to this in January and you'll see the usual people dismantling the film as yet another DC clusterfuck.
I'm a DC fan and I completely agree. This looks like ass. 
Fully agree. I was beginning to think I was crazy scrolling thru all the comments
Comic book fans are easily pleased. 
Tell that to the BvS trailer that completely destroyed every single reveal. 
Lol so did the glass crack
My first reaction from the shark was, "Oh boy! I can't wait for this to release in 2004!"
The whole trailer looked awful. 
This is EXACTLY what I thought of. Like all the incredibly high contrast details and colors on everything (lack of natural fuzzing/greyness in shadowed areas) combined with either zero or total motion blur (nothing in between).
Glad I’m not the only one to make this comparison 
That's the target audience after all
Wonder Woman and Aqua Man are kind of like Thor being gods etc. Aqua Man is kind of a demi-god and WW is like Percius if his mother was also an Amazon.
Im a sucker for a good villain though, that is why I am so excited for Black Manta and Orm. The best villains are the ones that challenge the hero's ideology. Look at the dark knight, captain america civil war, black panther, and daredevil. They had the best villains, not because they were powerful, but because their belief system was opposite that of the hero's
I'm moister than an oyster
Like somebody else said, the new Godzilla trailer has CGI way better than this and it comes out AFTER Aquaman, so I'm not getting my hopes up here.  
can't believe i'm more excited for Shazam than aquaman, but here we are 
Whenever I hear him speak all I can picture is six old white dudes in suits around a table and one says "People think Aquaman is super lame because of The Super Friends and jokes on Family Guy and Big Bang Theory, but I have a plan to make him cool again" and then he reveals his PowerPoint of cool words that kids say nowadays, like "ooh yeah" and "My man!"

 I literally sit there waiting for him to say "Cowabunga dude".
Thank you! After reading the comments I felt like the only one who thought this movie looked terrible.
She looks like she’s doing a little mermaid cosplay.
It's bizarre seeing so many highly rated comments praising this movie. At least it shows with the upvotes each trailer post has.
I knew what you meant, also do you really fuck squids?
Oh I'm 100% you're right and plan on gilding you after I see the movie haha
Disney's Tarzan did something similar.
A human seahorse is when you ride midget wearing a mermaid costume in a bathtub. 
... alright tell me. What's a human seahorse?
🙊
Yesyesyesyesyes
His show Barry was just nominated for 13 Emmy’s, 3 of those are for him specifically for writing, acting, and directing. I bet we’ll see it happen much sooner than 20 years. 

Also you should check out Barry. Great show. 
Who would have thought that the source with years of proved content would work? 
That is probably what Black Manta in a Christopher Nolan Aquaman movie would look like
I agree. What a clever bastard. Wish I'd thought of that.
Yeah, when he shot the lasers i thought they went Super Deformed style. 
Can't we have both him and Kaldur?
That would be the very best comicbook movie thing ever for me but the concept of sidekicks doesn't seem to be liked very much in the context of the adaptions to screen. (I remember something like 'Don't worry no Aqualad' from James Wan or someone else involved with the film).

So I would settle for any kind of inclusion of Garth. 
As a fan of young justice I'm hoping for Kaldur
Mask on, fuck it mask off
Meh, Manta feels less like an imposing presence and more like some random bad guy without the mask.
Fishmonger
Some would say the reverse.
That's a bold move considering making CGI  real underwater is pretty damn tricky. I'm intrigued.  
3/4 of earth is covered in water, so makes sense
Aquaman as Killmonger.
Not that great of a movie but it had some amazing visuals. 
Funny you say that, it's the same VFX Supervisor!

When his friends ask him what board game he wants to play, he says, "Catan!"
So edgy. Are you sure you're not from the CW universe?
My man!
Dressed like a bat!
LOOKIN' GOOD!
"Permission t..."

****rapid machine gun fire****

It's rude to interrupt.
This explains so much
Aquaman doesn't seem like a superhero that would be talking over the whole fight, like Spider-Man. Maybe a quip or two after the fight, but not during.
I don't ever feel like these one liners are cliches, probably because I've always loved them. But if they drop these one liners too often, it gets tiresome, for me at least. 
this is why "Hello There" is the perfect quip
Thats why JL Aquaman was perfect because his dialogue mostly consisted of:

"YEAH-yuh"

"AWE-riiiight"

"My MAAAAN"
Yup. Immediately thought of Fast Five.
Cavill will finally show the world the true advantages of the tactleneck.

While there are a few actors who could pull of a live-action Sterling Archer, Cavill was already so Archer-like in Man from U.N.C.L.E. that it feels wrong thinking of anyone else in the part.
I don't see why we can't do both.

I would also accept Jon Hamm.
It's called Man From U.N.C.L.E
Watch The Man from U.N.C.L.E.  Cavil is phenomenal, and reminds me so much of (a more competent version of ) Archer. 
It wasn't "snyder's vision". 

They brought Snyder in, on Nolan's advice, because they wanted to put Superman through the same treatment that Batman had received through Nolan. 

It was WB's vision, Snyder's job was to execute it. 
For noob in comic book lore like me, Synder vision in Man of Steel is actually interesting. 

The problem is Batman V Superman continued by Justice League and Suicide squad could not leave up the hype.

They tried to put too many elements of next movie, resulting not many time available for the development main plot and characterization.

Like how the Batman v Superman ultimate cut has a better review than the cinema cut.
Not necessarily true. The darker chracters stories are darker in tone while most DC Comics have a tone similar to Marvel comics. 

As someone who collects comics (but loves DC!)I can say that the 80s and 90s were WAY dark in regards to DC Comics however after the lukewarm New 52, DCs new Rebirth soft reboot is really colorful and vibrant. 

If I were to say what differentiates DC from Marvel is that DCs tone is more fantastical. There is alot more magic and mythology and the overpowered heroes are front and center. 


They did. He suits up in Aquaman. It's just not shown in this trailer. 
Well, I'd say about half of them definitely aren't so cheerful.
Sea Tech Horse Fish Wars


Blue Beetle and Booster Gold would be a great superhero version of Hot Fuzz
**Hal:** Something is *always* going on Guy! What about that guy, why do you think he's covering his face?

**Guy:** Maybe because he's fuck ugly.
Or lethal weapon, featuring Guy Gardner and John Stewart.


No luck catching sinestros then? 
I could honestly see a Shane Black-y buddy cop movie work well with Green Lantern. Have it be one of the human GL's- my gut says Jon Stewart because there aren't that many black superheroes in the DC canon but I'd rather they have Kyle Rayner (who's half Mexican IIRC) as a kind of goof and then Kilowog as a straight man, and they're just solving some sort of big crime or intergalactic conspiracy away from Earth and then at the end it turns out to be Sinestro or Annihilus or a Guardian gone rogue or something.
That’s exactly what they should do
I quite enjoyed Wonder Woman too, she got be inspiring and hopeful like she deserves. I feel like these more fantasy based movies allows DC to leave it's terrible cycle of overly edgy films.
Faster than a speeding bullet
"But Elon, Aquaman is a movie, Amber Heard is still on dry land!"

"You're a pedophile."
She's even hotter than whoever they cast in the porn remake of this ("Aquabang"?)
I feel like it fits for Atlantis, since underwater colors are muted to begin with. It's fitting to overindulge on the colors to make them stand out in a cultural sense. It's like an exaggerated version of how red Thor's cape was in the first movie, and how vibrantly green Loki's robes are. I like it.
Well a wig would come off underwater, duh! 
Dammit now you'll never get to see the movies...
I’m with you. I liked Edwards Godzilla fine but this sequel looks like my dream modern Godzilla.

🎶 *I wanna be your superhero, yeeeeaaah, oh yeeaaaah* 🎶
Don't forget two more scenes of  "WHHHAAA HOOOO" through the air
That's the shit I love just feed it to me just inject it right into my veins
Russians aren't the only ones that can use reddit to market their product I guess.

That said, I <3 Jason Mamoa so I'm hoping this does well.
I’m getting /r/hailcorporate vibes from this thread
Guess we are the cynical bastards then, but I can’t help it. I don’t get it. It’s basically a CGI movie, and it’s not even very good. “It’s not finished yet”. Bullshit, people always say that and the end result is *always* the same. The dialogue is shit, and it’s basically generic superhero plot #12-B from the archives. People are going apeshit over this the exact way they did over Suicide Squad or JL, and I just think it looks just as shit.
The astroturf on this thread is incredible. The top comments are exactly what you'd expect if the thread were, "Reddit, what are the most overused reddit comments?"  


This movie looks very bad.
Momoa is lookin like a snack, as usual, but the dude just cannot deliver dialogue. 
it's not impossible that some people are excited but it's also very possible that we're having a hail Corp situation going on. personally I agree with everything that's been said it looks pretty lame and generic
That was my reaction too. I'm surprised I had to scroll this far down to see a disagreeing opinion.
> Tell that to ~~the BvS trailer that completely destroyed every single reveal.~~ Zod’s snapped neck. 

ah yes there we go
that was the third trailer though, and it has been true for almost every blockbuster movie since. never watch the third trailer if you care about the story.

Look again at who you were talking to. Might want to be careful speaking treason around that man.
Moisture is the essence of wetness...
It'll look 10% better, tops. 

 I feel like I'm going around in circles with these trailers. Trailer comes out, looks like shit, someone says it looks like shit, someone says "they'll update the CGI for the actual release", movie comes out, it looks like shit... oh hey a new movie trailer.
It's more that he fucks in the *style* of a squid
It's 2018, don't be so judgemental.

Sarah Jessica Parker in the bathtub.
Just starting watching Barry, I second this recommendation.
X-Men in 2000: "NAH BOI, THAT YELLOW SPANDEX IS TOO CHEESY"  


Spider-Man in 2002: "Lmao"
Funny how that works. I'm pumped. 
Geez man, it's not like that source has an avid fanbase or anything. Nobody could have known being inspired by the source material was a good idea.
I mean, at least you were there to witness the battle of the brothers firsthand. 
Dear god. That is gonna be with me all week now.
Okoiye
Fishmonger out of Watermonger
The best thing to come out of the flash is the memes.
Nah, they actually Built a full underwtaer set and made the actors work under water for the whole production. Jason Mamoa was the only survivor
Watched it last night actually, and after being told it was hot garbage,  I was expecting the worst but honestly the visuals make it a not too bad popcorn flick to put on. 
The beginning was absolutely stunning and then Valerian shows up and the movie goes down hill from there. 
Reminded me of Sharknado
When Mera asks what he'd like for dessert, he says, "My flan!"
I didn't think Titans is part of the Arrowverse.
YES!
that's the kinda trope subversion Marvel likes to throw out sometimes, but even it is getting kind of trope-y, ironically. I dont know what follows next though Lol
ThisIsAmerica.WMV
I'm bulletproof
But you would need H. Jon Benjamin's voice. Half of what makes Archer is that voice and sarcastic tone. 
Don Draper in the Superman suit?

I'm not even mad, I'm impressed.



>I would also accept Jon Hamm. 
 
Me too 
  

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

We can, I was just be sassy.
dream movie. Jon Hamm as supes and Michael Keaton as Batman in Kingdom Come. Maybe Jennifer Connelly as Wonder Woman.Lets just old man everything.
I think Hamm might be too old for Archer at this point
And I demand a sequel or I am burning this country to the ground!
They clearly got the wrong message from Nolan's batman movies and tried to pull a gritty take on Superman (and likely would have continued that on the others), clearly it didn't work out
It was actually interesting reading New 52/DCYou/Rebirth side by side with Marvel Now/AllNew, All Different, at least with major characters and story arcs. You definitely had more intergalactic, time travel or magical stories with DC in regards to major crossovers, whereas Marvel focused on a lot of somewhat grounded sci fi or very intimate stories and topics that trended at the time. That’s not to say they were completely different since the roster on both publishers is so large, you have a such a variety of stories being told.
2Sea2Wars
Probably why he's single
LMAO
Straight out of Donkey Kong country
Sounded exactly like the goofy sound. 
Oh crap you right! sorry my liege u/TheAquaman
they never update.Look at Black Panther
Lots of ink
No judgements. I’m actually part squid and am going through a bit of a rut. Figured I’d kick the tires, take a chance, possibly find love.
Gotta be honest I was hoping and dreading for something different in that link.

X-Men First Class 2011: Fuck it, let's go for it anyway
I feel so betrayed that we never got to see Wolverine in the classic costume. They even teased it at the end of The Wolverine. 
The Fishmonger’s Wharf 

Oooo new restaurant name
T' Lapia
To me these memes have been dead for centuries
F
This is the kind of thing that sounds insane until you realise The Abyss did exactly that.

Granted, they were allowed to wear scuba suits, which probably helped.
When asked who bakes the best cookies, he says, "My Gran!"
I think it should just be H. Jon Benjamin as Archer. Don't acknowledge it at all and just have him play the live action Archer.

I liked Man of Steel, and even Batman v. Superman, and I agree 1000% with you. 

That would be like asking Wes Anderson to supervise a low-key cutesy cinematic universe out of the Rwandan Genocide. 

I'd enjoy the shit out of it, but it would be so wrong. 
Tokyo Bay Drift
His tentacles flail everwhere
Days of Future Past 2014: Nvm. 
Turns out to be the best X-Men film to date. Also not directed by Bryan Singer 🤔
Days of Future past had ONE scene where he actually had a decent-ish yellow costume! But he never fights in it, and they immediately send him to the 70s with his bone claws.   


[The promo pic makes me cry.](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/t/52eadd6be4b02e3a7e2b9933/1391123822478/?format=2500w)
Realistically this is their only foothold into being able to transition away from Hugh Jackman when he's done.

Execs: "X-men can be in the MCU now AND Wolverine has a yellow and blue suit!"

Fans: "Here's my cash!"

I have a feeling when he pops up in the MCU, we'll be pretty pleased.
THE ENLIGHTENMENT 
WE are the flash
When asked about the best director, he says, "James Wan!"
2Wet4Furious
Bryan Singer hates nerds.

Unless they're under 16, skinny and coked out of their age of consent. 
I made fun of it when it was revealed, even though it's what I wanted.

X-Men movies are a weird thing because they're based on a time when "hey comic book movies are cheesy let's be grounded and realistic" and then the MCU happened and they're trying to catch up by adding all this colorful stuff 
Bone claws were dope, though. I loved 70's wolverine. 
The MCU's done a fantastic job with their costumes. The leaked A4 Captain America suit looks *perfect*.
When Aquaman and Super friends go out for drinks and try to figure out which vehicle to take, he says "my Ram!"
When asked about why his contacts work underwater, he says, "My brand!"
Sea Wars 2: Electric Eel Boogaloo
I think the blue and yellow flight suits from First Class looked pretty good, and that movie was pre-Avengers 
When Aquaman turns on the TV to see what’s up in the world ‘C-Span’ 
Pre-Avengers, but not pre MCU
But it was still during the MCU, which was really starting to blow open.

I like the suits in DoFP's future as a nice balance, and to me Logan without his yellow suit in just a shirt and jeans is just as iconic a look, but

There was a point to this. I forgot. I do want to add that a big part of me making fun of the DoFP suit, though, was because 14 years earlier they were making fun of the "yellow spandex" in the first X-Men movie. Cyclops literally said it to Wolverine. Then Wolverine wore it.
When Aquaman switches to a new internet provider and his videos don't buffer he says, "My LAN!"
