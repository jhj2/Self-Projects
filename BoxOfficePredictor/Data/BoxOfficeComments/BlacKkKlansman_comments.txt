This movie is premiering right now at Cannes, so in a couple of hours we will know if this is a good Spike Lee joint.
"A Jew lie detector test." What?
Adam Driver man......loving how he's everywhere lately 
I'm going to predict that the scene where he's on the phone with David Duke saying he hates "Blacks, jews, mexicans, the irish..." is going to use some different language in the actual film. 
"Starring Adam Driver, Topher Grace, the really hot chick from Spider-man."

That all they needed to say to get me excited for this movie. 
Adam Driver is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
“With the right *hwhite* man, we can do anything”. Crying laughing. Looks like it’s doing 110% justice to its premise.
This looks... really fucking good.
looks like a nice return to form for Spike Lee, good cast, too
The new dynamic racial duo, ala Blazing Saddles.

[You've got to remember these are just racist morons](https://media1.giphy.com/media/scIHrlRU8zzCo/200.gif)
That phone call was hilarious.
Oof, the "America First!" at the end got me
Topher Grace as scrawny, racist David Duke looks like great casting.
Looks good! Nice to see a fellow Finn (Jasper Pääkkönen) in a big movie for once. Looks like a good part too.
"If I knew this was a clan I wouldn't have taken this Mother....."  

He did Nick Fury and Aunt May good! 
For a second there I thought that dude was gonna pretend to be in the KKK and never take his robes off or something 
Jasper Pääkkönen?

TORILLE
That Adam Driver shimmy turn on his chair during the phone call made me giggle.
I'm so pumped for this film!

Topher Grace is KKK leader David Duke! OMG. 
FINALLY Spike Lee tackles racism!
Sheeeeeeeit
SHYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET, thats Senator Clay Davis in this movie, friggin dope.
I love it, was going to watch cuz Adam Driver, but it looks fucking hilarious. 
A Dave Chappelle skit that went big screen. Who would have thunk it? 
Just heard it got a ten minute standing ovation today at Cannes where it premiered
Looks like good fun. Adam Driver is also really damn great so I can't wait to see him in more stuff.
I am very much about this
This movie will be terrible if I don't hear a single "shiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeet" from good ol Senator Clay Davis.
As long as I get to see Adam Drivers pecks, I'm a happy man.😄
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity… but now you have my attention.

Edit: "America First." A *lot* of ~~pwecious wittle snowflakes~~ people are going to get sooooooooooooo riled up even when it's not talking about them directly.
Is nobody else going to acknowledge this is literally loosely based on a true story. Makes it even more hilarious. A black police officer infiltrated the KKK over the phone, even asking the leader “how do you know that I’m not black”

To which he replied something along the lines of “I’d easily be able to hear it in your voice”
I've always been a Spike Lee fan but felt a lot of his recent movies have been lacking it a little.  This looks like it's gonna be incredible.
David Duke is still alive lol. he ran for congress back in 2016. I wonder how he'll react.
ITT: people pissed off about a movie that makes the KKK look like the bad guys
Holy shit this actually makes amazing, I havent been too hot on some of Lee's recent films but I cant wait to see this one
[NPR's story on the actual incident that the movie is based on](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5219349)
Interesting sign of the times when Peele’s producing credit carries the same weight as Lee’s directing. 
Cool. Colorado Springs 1st big movie and its about the KKK 🤦🏽‍♂️ 
undercover brother 2 looks pretty serious and not as funny...
Just waiting for a Clayton Bigsbey camio.
John Washington (co main) is Denzel Washingtons son for those who don't know.
Adam driver, so hot right now. 
This looks amazing. I just wish it wasn't set in the town I grew up in haha. 
"I hate Blacks, I hate Jews, Mexiacans and Irish. Italians and Chinese. I hate those Black rats."

I have a feeling that whole scene was edited for the trailer. I imagine it being a lot more vulgar in the actual movie. 
[deleted]
If Clayton Bigsby doesn't make an appearance I'll be slightly put off.
Fuck Spike Lee. Ever since he tweeted the wrong address out during that Trayvon shit, I lost all respect for him. 
The story is so ridiculous, that it makes sense to make a more humorous film. Its amazing how much John David sounds like his father.
Questioned Topher’s role in this until I just saw a picture of David Duke.

Great casting.

This looks like it’s gonna be at least decent. 
Didn't this actually happen? Sounds familiar. 
Man, Adam Driver is really making a solid name for himself. 
Holy shit it's Sazh
Undercover brother
Can i see this movie, like now? 
Am I the only one who actually read the book this movie is based on? I see no one mentioning it.
Uuuh, I hadn't heard it was a Spike Lee film!

This immediately makes me more excited for this already amazing looking movie.
I know it's just one moment, but when it cut directly between the KKK chanting "White Power" and the (I guess they're Black Panthers) chanting "Black Power". I'm really interested to see what the film does with that dynamic. 
Adam is in everything these days
I miss Chapelle.
I've lived in Springs my whole life so this will be interesting.
So...Blazing Saddles 2 then?
[Ya'll wann see my face?](https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/979/755/4755979.gif)
wHite
With this and Sorry to Bother You coming out about the same time I can finally get the "using your white voice" double feature I never dreamed would happen.
This looks way better than I thought it would.
We saw the movie yesterday. Spike Lee has still got it -- great movie! The cast, especially the 'bad guys/gals', were great. Highly recommended.
I thought this was an SNL skit
I'm happy to see Topher Grace in interesting roles.
I wish they'd stop with those stupid fucking pre-trailer stingers. It's obnoxious and doesn't set any tone aside from "HEY. YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH A TRAILER, DON'T GET INVESTED"
Oh man the Springs! I live near there. That's neat having a movie take place where I could drive to.
This looks like a fucking Coen Brothers film. I LIKE it!
Why the fuck is there a trailer FOR the trailer, RIGHT BEFORE the trailer?!
Kylo looks weird in this
This looks amazing. I'm so hyped. 
oh boy. Another reason to have a conversation about race in the least racist country in the world. 
America first. Where have I heard that before? 
In the words of Bill Burr, I’m running out of white guilt. 
All this reminds me of is the story of how my father, a black state trooper, by accident got an invite card to join the KKK all because he had a white sounding name.  
Looks fun 
Damn I didn't know Topher Grace was in this. Looks super entertaining, I'm in. 
I read the book a while back. It was pretty good. Tense and darkly funny at times. Seems Spike Lee's adopted this tone for his adaptation. Yeah, I look forward to seeing it. 

For those interested in the book: 
*Black Klansman* by Ron Stallworth (self-published, 2014), currently out of print, but according to Google, it'll be reissued under Penguin as *Black Klansman: Race, Hate, and the Undercover Investigation of Lifetime* in June this year. 
Why is there 5-second trailer-trailers in the front of all of my trailers??????
The second thing Jordan Peele took from Dave Chappelle...
Notice how David Duke 40 years later is still the only recognizable face of the white power movement...shows you how insignificant it really is.
This is a serious crime movie but there's going to be a ton of excellent dark comedy.
It's like a 21 Jump Street about racism. I'm so on bored.
America First...hmm...where else have I heard that line?  
Fuck this looks amazing. 
Why do they put trailers for the trailer at the beginning of the trailer? 
And we'll see how good Adam Driver is at playing a hwite officer playing John David Washington to meet the KKK face to face.

Sidenote: The reason JDW's voice is so familiar but not? He's Denzel's son. He's also pretty good on Ballers.

Edit: Adam Driver is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
[Emily Yoshida, movie critic at Vulture](https://twitter.com/emilyyoshida/status/996121460006637568): 

> BLACKKKLANSMAN is electric, and its final moments are inspiring, painful and invigorating in that order. It is also, frequently, fucking hilarious, in a way that hurts.

10 minute ovation

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-spike-lees-blackkklansman-draws-10-minute-standing-ovation-1111550
This might be Spike Lee's one good movie of this decade... 

Previous winners: Do the Right Thing (80s), Malcolm X (90s), and Inside Man (00s)
Oh, it will be. Guaranteed. 
Word is apparently it's fantastic and the best thing he's done in years.
Looks like the best one in quite some time
Wait until they figure out lie detectors were invented by a BDSM-obsessed, polyamorous, feminist [weirdo](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/wonder-womans-kinky-feminist-roots/380788/).

(Who also happened to be the creator of Wonder Woman). 
That reminds me of the Louis Theroux episode where the KKK were asking him if he was a jew or not.
That is to funny to me. 
Using a lie detector on Kylo Ren? 
"Would you like some bacon?"

"Yes" - pass

Any other answer - fail
I have a dollar...do you want it?

No

**Beepbeepbeepbeepbeep**
He's also been working on some pretty interesting projects the last five years, many of them with amazing directors with an interesting visual style or way of directing. With the Coen brothers on *Inside Llewyn Davis*. Jim Jarmusch's *Paterson*. Martin Scorsese's *Silence*. Soderbergh's *Logan Lucky*. Tery Gilliam's *The Man who Killed Don Quixote* and two Noah Baumbach-movies. 

It's like in between playing Kylo Ren he does all these good movies with nuanced characters that tend to do well in award season.
He’s gonna be the next big reddit obsession. Just like Chris Pratt was a couple years ago 
He will rule the Hollywood galaxy.
For his age he’s an outstanding actor. To me I think he’s the main reason why the new Star Wars have been so good. 
The Law of Star Wars dictates that only one main actor per trilogy can go onto wider fame. Harrison Ford for the originals, Natalie Portman for the prequels and it's looking like Driver for the sequels. I mean, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac and Daisy Ridley are all still getting work, but nothing interesting like Driver is
Cauliflower
Half of Tumblr is in love with him.
And I remember when he was just an unknown actor masturbating in front of Lena Denham on Girls.
I still think that topher grace is underrated
#HARD R
You're so right. Movie looks great. 
I saw the trailer a while back for a survey and it was definitely not censored. It was quite jarring lol.
Could not agree more, I pictured something a little more descriptive to get them all to turn around slowly. 
He was alright in Spider-Man 3, but I wouldn’t say he was a “really hot chick”. 
holy shit she's 28 years old
>the really hot chick from Spider-man

Marisa Tomei?
You're trash, Brock.
Why did you list Topher Grace twice?
The lead actor is Denzel Washingtons son, John Washington (Ballers)
> hot chick from spider-man

marisa tomei?
Emma Stone is in this movie? 
That sounds complex but really describes every movie where a character goes undercover.
Guest starring Kirk Lazarus
Funny you say that, the song used in this trailer is also used in the opening of Tropic Thunder!
this had be cracking up so hard
We're just gonna use some titanium hwite to paint some happy little clouds
Cool *Hwip*
I noticed the way he said that but I think I'm out of the loop here. How does the way he pronounced white do justice to the premise?
Man, Denzel's son really sounds exactly like Denzel. 

I'm very, very excited for this.
I agree... This trailer surpassed my expectations entirely! 
It's been awhile since we had a dope ass Spike Lee movie
Agreed, looks fucking fantastic actually, reminds me of a similarly shot "The Nice Guys" for some reason. Can't wait 
Yeah huh. The name looked like a corny play at the kingsman at first, but then watching that trailer with those actors and the talent behind it? Count me in.
The tone is not at all what I expected when I had first read about this movie a while back.

I also can't wait for David Duke to bitch about his portrayal. I hope Topher Grace makes him out to be every ounce of the the hateful weak scumbag he is. 
Feels so weird to see Jasper Pääkkönen in this one. Though he did crack the international scene in Vikings. 
I was surprised to see this was his first film to go to Cannes since Jungle Fever. It's definitely been a while! 
“You’ve got to remember that these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West. You know… morons.”
SCUSE ME WHILE I WHIP DIS OUT
"THE SHERIFF IS A [BONG]"
He really sounded like his father on the call. 
Reminded me of Herbert Moon from Red Dead Redemption.
Yeah, the Trump supporters will be unhappy. 
In my book Topher Grace as anyone is a good casting.
Had to Google to see who you were talking about ,but love that guy in Vikings .

Samuli Edelmann was in one of the Mission Impossible movies too! Although Jasper's role looks much bigger.
He hid his accent so well! Usually us Finns just sound like we're talking with such... effort.
I was just trying to hear if he really can get away with the deep south accent without any rally english.
Wait, that was Topher Grace? Huh, cool
I've just seen the whole film in the trailer. All the characters, plans and quips.
lol
I think there's still some racism left to tackle.
Haha I was wondering when id see this post. 

Sheeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiiittttt
This is the comment I came looking for. 
It's actually based on a true story
With all due respect, if that statement is true, is any movie really THAT good? A 10 minute standing ovation for any movie would be obnoxious! 
Maybe the movie's great, but I'd take the reaction Cannes with a grain of salt. Fighting racism is "in" and movie-festival-goers are known to savor how forward they are.
https://memestatic.fjcdn.com/pictures/Street+art_bca09f_6476891.jpg
Swolo
The new She’s Gotta Have it on Netflix was awesome
Can’t deny Colorado Springs’ (and lots
rural Colorado) racist-ass history, the vestiges of which are still lingering today. 
You are asking for too much there man. That being said, Clayton Bigsby is such a hilarious character. 
It's for youtube 5 second skippable ads
It's been around since WW2, mostly used by nazi sympathizers in America as an excuse for not entering the war.
For youtube 5 sec skippable ads. 
The movie is based upon a true story, though. 
That is because it is engrained in white society. Entire white towns used to go watch lynchings as if they were watching a movie. You do not have a singular face when everyone is propagating it. 
My guess would be to use for those 5 Second ads on YouTube and other sources like that.
>John David Washington

I had no idea he was Denzel's son, but it makes so much sense now. 
Yeah it was fuckin creepy how he sounded so much like DW that whenever the camera panned away during that KKK phone call I seriously thought it was DW talking.
On top of the guy sounding like Denzel, I also thought I saw Steve Buscemi in there (detective sitting left of Adam Driver in the phone call scene), but turns out it was his brother Michael.
> Adam Driver is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.

Fits right in. He played a dude disguised as Darth Vader in Force Awakens.
>The reason JDW's voice is so familiar but not? He's Denzel's son.

I had no idea, but this is amazing on so many levels.

Spike Lee helped launch Denzel's career in Mo Better Blues(1990) and Malcolm X(1992); which was Denzels first Oscar nomination. So to see him help his son out in the same kind of way is awesome.
That's who that is!  He was the best part of Ballers when I was watching it.
"I'm a dude playing another dude disguised as another dude!".  
Wait, wrong movie
If you saw Adam driver in Logan lucky, he can do a pretty good white American accent with a bit of country
cool hwip
That's where i seen him from. I knew I've seen this dude in somethin'.
[The film just got a long standing ovation at Cannes](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/spike-lee-cannes-standing-ovation-blackkklansman-film-festival-2018-adam-driver-a8351996.html)
Big fan of Adam Driver, so count me in.
> He's also pretty good on Ballers

Fuck I knew I knew who it was but could not think of from where.
Welp, that sells me. Any movie that gets praised for it's ending is a cut above.
I feel like I've read this 10 minute ovation shit for a few other movies in the past couple years. 

Spike Lee could do with a good movie though. He hasn't made one in more than a decade. More "Do The Right Thing" and less "Oldboy" please god.
What about The 25th Hour?
X was a BIG deal when it came out. We even took a school trip to see it right around the holidays. That’s when Spike really came into the limelight. My principles son had a small role in it too, from what I remember.  

What a career. He persevered and defined NY culture throughout the 80’s and 90’s. For that alone, I’ll always admire him.  
Inside man was on point. 
The morality plays of He Got Game and Red Hook Summer are good movies. Spike is Fellini-esque, in a sense, that some of his movies don't fall into a specific category.
Chi-Raq is kind of a mess but when it works it REALLY fucking works. 
He got game is great.
No love for He Got Game?
I would say that but...he has not directed a movie I liked since 2006. 
I just watched that movie with Luke Evans and thought it was pretty cool, had no idea about the BDSM link to WW but... I mean, it really makes sense now.

Interesting ... my college professor only mentioned the Wonder Woman part ... wonder why ...
They kept asking because he kept refusing to answer. He never said yes or no. He's a brave man.
If I recall correctly Louis said that the KKK episode was one of the worst he had filmed. The scene in the garage (where they suspected he was Jewish) was almost certainly going to go *very* wrong for Louis and the crew, they bailed on that one very quickly. 
What's going to be even funnier is the questions. I'm just guessing, but I'm guessing he's going to pass with flying colors because they're all going to be racist shit like, 

"Do you steal and hoard gold from the white man?"
I sent the trailer to my buddy that’s Jewish . Awaiting his response 
Fun fact:  This was an actual tactic used by the Spanish Inquisition.
He killed it in Paterson. He seems willing to make some sacrifices in the roles he takes to work with elite directors. 
Oh god I watched Silence on a 10 hour plane trip \(to Japan of all places\) and that was one of the most miserable, depressing movies I have ever watched. 

Good movie, I think, but I'm never watching it again. 
His character is one of the only likeable/redeemable characters in Girls
When you get that Star Wars money you can afford to make some weird shit in between
Personal opinion: Driver is an outstanding actor but for some reason is super uninteresting to me but in amazing projects. The opposite for me is Tom Hardy who is often in middling projects but I watch the movie or show just because he's in it. Either way, I've seen everything each of them has been in, just for opposite reasons. 
I would love to see him in a Wes Anderson movie. 
It's a smart move for someone with his skill level hitting a good streak of years in his career. He will be able to take any role he wants. 
[deleted]
Implying that Reddit isn't already obsessed with him...r/StarWars used to have a different "DAE love Adam Driver?" thread on its front page practically every day, for *months*, after *The Last Jedi* was released.
Pretty sure he already is, I know I'm obsessed with him. 
Did you just say cauliflower to me?
I’ve loved Adam driver for s few years now. Everything he is in is good. 

Chris Pratt, however, has turned in to a typical boring action star. I miss Andy Dwyer.
And he deserves it
Driver seems to keep to himself a lot outside work. He should be fine.
I always thought he was kind of annoying. Reddit's kind of annoying too though so I guess it kind of makes sense
iRRRRRRRRish
That explains everyone in the room’s reaction when he’s on the phone then. Right now, assuming they know what his mission is, that wouldn’t get much of a reaction, but if he starts using some really bad slurs, it would.
She was 7 years older than basically all the other "teens" in that movie. 
>holy shit she's 28 years old

No she's not... *goes on IMDB*

holy shit she's 28 years old! 
[removed]
There's a scene in the movie where they make fun of her having a crush on Spidey and joke about how he must be a 30 year old man under the mask. I was like "lady, that's you in a couple of years".

She's gorgeous though.
Lmao right? I was like this chick really paying a 15 yo in spider man jesus
Never would have guessed she was my age. Also Holy shit we I was born the day before her.
The actress who played aunt May, Marisa Tomei, is 53.
Laura Harrier. She played Liz.
the really hot black one

Not a paper in town will hire me
I had no idea, that is cool. I have never watched ballers. I hope he is good in this movie.
No Liz, the girl Peter was into and was supposed to be a teenager.  She's the one who was 28.  
My first thought was Kirsten Dunst. 
It was more complex in Tropic Thunder. 

Robert Downey Jr. was a white actor playing a white actor playing a black dude disguised as an asian dude.
[deleted]
>cracking


Haha get it?
Phthalo blue or gtfo
HWeet Thins 
Yeah I'm lost too
holy shit thats denzels son?!
Yeah when I would watch him on Ballers, it would sound like I was listening to Denzel if you close your eyes.
He will propably play denzel at some point 
Adam Driver tends to only be in good projects. I trust anything he's joined. 
>  reminds me of a similarly shot "The Nice Guys" for some reason


*for some reason*
Although I'm not actually surprised, it is not the first time Spike Lee has blended comedy with serious subject matters. 
> I also can't wait for David Duke to bitch about his portrayal.

That's gonna be so fun. But I'm curious how they were able to use his real name. Don't they have to get Duke's life rights?
> I hope Topher Grace makes him out to be every ounce of the the hateful weak scumbag he is.

I miss the good old days when showing someone as leader of the KKK would be considered enough in itself to accomplish that. The days before "very fine people on both sides."
Dude, Topher Grace is playing him. I guarantee he's fucking pissed haha
And its already second time he is acting white supremist.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2343617/?ref_=nv_sr_1
Doesn't it? I used to make fun of him when he was in the Finnish drama scene but I've rooted for him since Vikings S4.

Also I've farted in an elevator he's in. Feels even weirder.
IIRC that was an improvised line.
Where the white women at?! 
Holy shit! Didn’t know who his father was until this comment. 🤯
They shouldn’t be. The Klan’s been saying that for a hundred years. If you copy the Klan, you can’t be mad when people don’t like you for it. 
Not like they were going to see a Spike Lee movie. 
Good. Anything that makes those pricks unhappy is awesome
Even as Venom? 
And that one guy was a dead body in CSI!
There's a saying that Finland comes 10-20 years behind Sweden and since Hollywood is already infested with Swedes with no accent, maybe it's Finns' turn?
I'd be tired too after using all those cases.
He's got the Eric Forman haircut, add a bad moustache. 
And thus began the 411th crusade against racism
Sheeeeeiiiiiit
Cannes is known for having super long standing ovations, but it's still a good sign that the movie's gonna be good.
Super pretentious as well.
At Cannes the film crew and producers are usually attending the premiere (or pop in as the credits roll). A 10mn standing ovation is really for them, very much like in a play or a broadway show. 
Also, this makes the boo'ing a much more vicious affair. 
That, my friend. Is a fucking beauty.
Oh it's even older than that. 

http://thedollop.libsyn.com/205-the-sydney-ducks
Woah I had no idea either, he’s pretty good in Ballers 
I remember watching season 1 of ballers where he got serious and gave a speech about his dad in the show.  I was like holy shit that has to be Denzel’s kid.  Googled it and was not surprised.  He’s a good actor, hope to start seeing him in more projects outside of ballers. 
[Definitely looks just like his father here.](https://i.imgur.com/TzoBXTP.png) even sounds like him in some of the cutscenes.
Fuuuuck he looks just like him. I didn't see it before.
ive never seen anyone confirm paternity from audio but you could do it for Denzel and his son. if you listened to both of them blindfolded you cant tell the  difference. blew my mind when i saw him on ballers
Michael Washington?
He also plays a guy (Ben Solo) pretending to be someone he's not (Kylo Ren). 
>>Spike Lee helped launch Denzel's career in Mo Better Blues(1990) and Malcolm X(1992); which was Denzels first Oscar nomination.

Denzel's first Oscar nomination was for Best Supporting Actor in Cry Freedom in 1987. He won in 1989 with Glory. Malcolm X was his first nomination for Best Actor.

Cannes audiences are a bunch of circus seals. They think anything remotely okay is the next coming of Christ. 
Clerks II got a ten minute standing ovation at Cannes and it's fine but by no means ovation-worthy.
Chi-Raq was pretty well-received iirc.
Chi-raq was a pretty good movie.
Chi-Raq was certainly more DTRT and less Oldboy.
Crooklyn? It wasn't a hit, but it's such a good film.

Inside Man?
Honestly I think The 25th Hour is one of his best movies period.  Up there with Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X.
I remember my Dad taking us to see Malcolm X and they gave us tickets to Mighty Ducks. They told us the ticket machine was broke and they could only print Mighty Duck tickets, but they marked the ticket so the usher would know we were there to see Malcolm X.

My Dad said bullshit and told the clerk that we were never going to spend money at that theater again.


I'll never forget that shit.
I really wanted a sequel.
Last film of his I loved was, Inside Man. So I respect your taste, thus far. 
No love for Chi-Raq?
Didn't he do the remake of oldboy?


I'm not defending this movie lmao. Just wanted to point out the reason I won't be going to see another one of his movies in theaters after that monstrosity
you know luke evans? cool
The threeway scene where they're basically dressed as WW, Cheetah, and Steve Trevor is worth the price of admission.
I mean he weakness is being tied up and she lassos people up. 
If you look at all the early wonderwoman comics, there's a lot of rope involved.
gotta love those lie detecting ropes
I can fap to this...
He explained why he didn't want to answer in an interview (I think it was with Joe Rogan) and it kind of made sense.

Those idiots were so sure that he was a jew though with their heightened jew-dar senses and confirmation bias
Are you the bear Jew? Do you believe in hwite Jesus the lord and sav-e-ior?
Tell me what was his response. 
Well, when you making SW kind of money you have that kind of liberty.

Dude it's one of my favorite movies of all time.  I get that it's heavy but it's so well written and means alot to me as a religious person, because I often go through the same struggles as Andrew Garfield's character.  
I wouldn’t say likeable always, but definitely the most interesting.
What we're just forgetting about Ray?
I gave up after the first season, but by the end of that I was basically only watching it for him. He's electric in his scenes.
Tom Hardy has done a lot of great movies too though. Bronson, Locke, Dunkirk, Mad Max, etc.
Oops. A typo that snuck in last night. Thanks for the correction!
We need an Adam and Chris buddy cop movie set in space
Kind of makes sense, they wanted to make sure and give her character that "senior girl" aura since everybody else was younger.

Also they didn't shy from shooting her ass while she walked away in that bathing suit, so I knew she had to be a little bit older.
A lot of the teenagers in the movie were actual teenagers. Some of the competition kids were actually fourteen. She would've been 12 years older than them at the time.
Reminds me of Stacey Dash in Clueless 
She came from the same factory that churned out the entire casts of The OC and One Tree Hill then.

Oh damn
That's wild
I was surprised to find out that Kate Upton is barely one year older than me. She's almost 26 but looks like a really, really good looking woman in her mid thirties.
What the fuck Laura Harrier is 28?

Toby maguire will always be OG movie Spider-Man ❤️
I think the best part is they used "Ball of Confusion" by The Temptations in this trailer, which was also featured in the intro to Tropic Thunder
He was really just a dude playing a lead farmer
I get the reference.
Just a touch. 
"Why are you putting so much emphasis on the H?"
Yeah. I’ve seen that dude in stuff and had no idea. If you look at his filmography it’s quite obvious he has some connection though. TIL

His first gig is a small role in Malcom X. His second is producer Co Producer of Book of Eli. That’s quite the career advancement. 
Holy shit, Ricky is Denzel's son? 
He's so hot right now
You weren’t kidding. I checked his Wikipedia page, and the worst thing he’s been in was *J. Edgar*, and that sounded pretty good on paper.
He's on a roll lately
Cauliflower 
Watch Paterson
See Bamboozled for study.
We don't talk about Chi-Raq
The movie is based on a memoir, so that might make a difference.
They just have to say David Duthe
Can't wait for the complaints about how this movie is racist against whites.
The "America First" toast in the film is clearly shots across the bow on exactly that subject.
Topher Grace seems like a good guy, but I think getting portrayed by him has to be downright insulting. 
The way he's cracking up at the delivery is so genuine it seems like he definitely wasn't expecting it.
Just the morons part was improvised. Hence the unexpected laugh. 
And for my next impression, Jesse Owens..
The sheriff is a n*DING DONG*r

I think he said the sheriff is a near!!

😂
I recently rewatched Hackers, and the scene where Zero Cool is taking over the TV station has him knocking another show off the air. The show where a racist dude is going on about how black people are inferior and all that. The name of the show is "America First". So it is just another example that the phrase has been around for a while and is associated with racism.
and MAGA is also ripped from Reagan's campaign slogan. I'm sure Reagan got it from some often said old saying. 
I don't get what's wrong with the phrase though? Of course you would put America first, I mean it's your own country.
*Psht* shows what you know. They actually screen He Got Game before every rally.
I still plan on going to see it...
I'm sure someone will pick through it so they can make shitty meme and take things out of context.
Peter Franzen! He was in Vikings too with Jasper.
On top of that the Cannes audience loves to boo the shit out of movies. They're just a really vocal and theatrical crowd.
I really don’t get how anyone could clap for that long. clapping for like 10 seconds gets repetitive 
>but it's still a good sign that the movie's gonna be good.



Definitely not the case. Tons of movies get standing ovations, yes, but not a sign of anything. "Clerks 2" got an 8 minute standing ovation and "A House That Jack Built" got a 6 minute one today and over 100 people walked out. It's an interesting tidbit, but means absolutely nothing for the quality of the movie. 



How is that pretentious?
He was pretty underwhelming for the Rams, though. 
cutscenes? someone’s been playing too many video games lately ;)
Damn, maybe we can get an Equalizer 3 prequel with him starring, if the second one turns out as good as the first.
Tom and Collin Hanks are a close second for audio paternity
Michael Buscemi 
Ya but he's definitely not pretending to be [swolo](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/001/330/679/202.jpg) tho
This guy Denzel's
hwip, cool hwip
The irony is that Adaptation's ending wowed me due to its unconventional force. The ending to that same writer Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche New York was similarly hard-hitting, too.
I liked how his brother (who writes exagerated cliche hollywood stories) said he'd help with the ending so the actual last scene is more over the top and movie like than the rest of the film
Rare that you see people wishing there were more smug elitists around.
What? Cannes is famous for its boos and walkouts. I agree the judges have given the Palme to poor films in the past few years, but that’s silly to say the audience is always jovial and easy to please. Tree of Life won the Palme and got a mixture of boos and applause. 
You take that back. Clerks 2 was a masterpiece for [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPl5MeXIM8E) alone.
Doesn't everything get a 10 minute ovation at cannes?
A lot of people are saying this. I might check it out as Lysistrata is a favorite of mine. Seems to be a word for word adaptation of the play though. Don't know how I feel about that.
I'll up the ante and say it's one of the best movies of that decade.
So youre saying the theatre was fudging the ticket sales?
Yeah man, back then there weren’t as many big multiplexes, and there could be a big distance between the two. They probably knew the other place showing it was far. That’s real fucking cute. Like they thought your old man wouldn’t notice, lol. 

On top of that, this is X were talking about, and not The Mighty Ducks, so I don’t know about where you’re from, but I remember my teacher telling us that only a handful of theaters in many cities were showing it. It was in a lot of theaters on Long Island and in Queens(where we saw it). 

Edit: grammar 
That's badass on your dad's part.
So did they. Weird that it was a decent sized hit for the time, had Denzel in it, but no one wanted to fund another one.
Inside Man is fantastic.

>My name is Dalton Russell. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. I've told you my name: that's the Who. The Where could most readily be described as a prison cell. But there's a vast difference between being stuck in a tiny cell and being in prison. The What is easy: recently I planned and set in motion events to execute the perfect bank robbery. That's also the When. As for the Why: beyond the obvious financial motivation, it's exceedingly simple... because I can. Which leaves us only with the How; and therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.
TIL. I had no idea Spike Lee directed that.
I mean it had some good stuff in there, but it was a jumbled mess as an overall film, I think. It's good compared to something like Red Hook Summer, but not good at all compared to his actual movies, in my opinion. 
Yeah, I thought Chi-Raq was pretty much considered by everyone to be a solid return to form for Lee.

At the very least, I really enjoyed it.
It wasn't good.
Oof case in point
Technically not a Spike Lee "Joint". He was upset with the studio cut of it and made it so it's called a "Spike Lee Film" on the poster. 
Yeah, it was garbage.
I love the Korean original Oldboy, never saw Spike Lee's remake.  Is the negative reaction because it was just a bad adaptation, poorly done movie?  Or because a lot of Americans / you personally just didn't like the concept of the movie?  I'm just curious.  Have you seen the original?  I almost want to see Spike Lee's because it gets such awful word of mouth around here, but I also... don't care, the original is perfect for me.
Come on...Chiraq was amazing!
Yeah he bought me some Twizzlers even though I'm into Red Vines but enough about our sex life 
Wait what? I think I missed some context, I need it.
He's happy with the representation. Me and him love Driver and he knows he's about to do some justice. He said that knowing all the types of bagels would be on the Jew detector test. 
I'm a militant Atheist but that movie was so good it almost turned me christian again.
I think the movie was shot beautifully, and had some unforgettable scenes. But, the ending is just.. what? I thought it really undermined the legacy of thousands of Jesuit martyrs. 
Oh he definitely has! I adore Peaky Blinders and think that Mad Max was the best action movie of the decade!

She might even still be 12 years older than them!
Nicceee... I ~~may~~ will look those up later
Hwat?
He's one of the main actors in Ballers on HBO. Only found out he was his son after looking him up. 
Yes and John David Washington also had a brief stint in the NFL as well on practice squad teams. 
He might even be as hot as Hansel
I concur 
Adam.
He's always been hot. Aging like a fine wine, though. 
If I was an actor and could wish upon a star for a career, i'd want to be either Adam Driver or Denzel Washington and I feel like alot of people would feel the same way
Ocean's 7-11
I have, loved it. 
That is an excellent film. 
There already is. Read the comment section.
Thats the good thing about freedom of speech brah, err'one gets it! 
It's more that the "America First" phrase has a direct history tied to that. It was the phrase used by pro-Nazis before WWII too. It's not so much a shot at the current users of it as the current users are intentionally referencing the bad stuff, using weak dog whistles to play at innocent from those who don't pay attention.
Hack the Planet! 
The phrase alone is fine. The problem is their idea of what America is and what it means to put that version of America first. If we were talking economics or something innocent, fine. But historically it’s been used to push a white supremacist or white isolationist agenda. If the Klan says it, you should consider that it’s not entirely innocent. 
American-based Nazis, the Klan and George Wallace's anti-Civil Rights campaign all utilized this phrase. 

Taken at face value, there isn't anything wrong with the phrase, but its context is frequently problematic, suggesting an exclusionary sentiment. The phrase "America First" is often associated with antipathy towards nonwhites and foreigners. 
A lot of phrases that might not technically be wrong becomes bad because of its association with certain groups, it is the same reason why "all lives matter" is shitty, because it has been used almost exclusively as a way to shut down black voices talking about the racism they experience. 

And it is not on accident, they chose these benign phrases on purpose as a way to package their racism into something more presentable. Because if you criticise their usage of racist rhetoric, they might defend themselves by saying something similar to what you just said. So if they say "America First" and you criticise them for it they can turn it around and accuse you of being disloyal to your country.  

(I'm not accusing you of supporting these sentiments, just to be clear)
Propaganda is *supposed* to sound “good and innocuous”. 

But. 

It also allows a person to become open to be persuaded. “America first” sounds good because we’re all Americans and America is an amazing and great country.


But.

“America first” as a phrase means nothing. America is *nothing* without its values. Nationalism over individual rights is exactly the opposite of everything America was founded and built on. “America first, American values second”, isnt quite as catchy.

Arbeit macht Frei also sounds perfectly fine in isolation. Context is everything.
Because it isn't just the phrase, it's what is behind the phrase, they don't mean all of America  first, they mean the white, judeo christian, male section of America, and the rest of it can get out, or learn to live beneath them, if that's all good, then sure it's a great phrase, but you can't remove context, context is what gives things their meaning.
If you're not first you're last. 
On top of what's been said, you shouldn't put your country first just because it's your country. Patriotism is blinding. 
Oh yeah that one.
Also there have been movies have been boo'd by the audience and then won the palme d'or. 
I heard hes Denzel Washington's son
I'm not sure what its called when they cutaway but the voice from the previous scene is playing. 
Kylo Ben. AKA Ben Swolo.
You’re one of the few people I encountered familiar with Synechdoche, New York. One of my all-time favourites but man was it rough to watch while in grad school for theatre.
Further irony: Later in this exact line from McKee, he says "Don't you *dare* use a deus ex machina"

The McKee character, in the story of Adaptation., *is* himself a deus ex machina.
Adaptation. is such a smart movie. Endlessly rewatchable; you notice new stuff (like this) every time you watch.
There's a pretty wide gap between a smug elitist and someone who keeps clapping for 10 minutes straight like an insane person because they've just seen a good movie.

I'm not elitist at all I'll watch anything and give it a chance, but even if I love every minute of a movie I don't clap even once, just walk out and talk to my friends about how good it was. Now granted Cannes is different because people involved in the movie are probably there so it's an ovation for them, but still 10 minutes of constant clapping is fucking crazy.

Even in theater after a fun play they do like 5 minutes tops, with breaks in between as the actor run of stage and then run back on for another bow. And even then my palms sting a little when it's all over.
I’d say there’s a difference between being “smug” and having standards for critical reviews. 
So what your actually saying is that the audience at Cannes don't know which way is up and will boo or applause like they are on a TV Audience. With a little direction and mob mentality.

---

I have never seen a movie that I would clap for even 30 seconds of my life for. Yet alone 10 minutes
I thought to myself, "gotta be the Lord of the rings bit" and you did not disappoint. 
Anyone got any mirror?

Either that, or the audience walks out. Very hot or very cold, those Cannes audiences.
It's definitely not.

Knowing the source material will help, but it's a *very* different story. I don't think any individual lines are taken from the play verbatim.

It's also super over-the-top, I loved it, but it's about half as subtle as Do the Right Thing. 
Sure seemed like it, but I don't know enough about the ticket printing machines of that era to know if the clerk was telling the truth.
im missing something here, why is this bad?
Honestly as a 10 year old kid all I heard was Mighty Ducks and I thought we were going to get to see Malcolm X and Mighty Ducks. I was a little upset when we left the theater but it made sense to me when I was older.
Yeah, I always wondered what happened with the supposed sequel. I really really wanted to see more of Clive Owen.
25th hour was incredible too.
"I'm gonna walk right out the front doors." 
“I will not repeat myself…”
Edited to play that twice and totally undercuts the value of the line and its delivery.

I was pissed when I saw it.
It's his one, sort of non racial social message joint. 
First movie I ever walked out of the theater.

Jack and Jill didn't even make me leave. I wear that one as a badge of honor
So besides confusing red, ropey candies, what's he like in bed?
I haven't seen it, but I'm guessing it's [this](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6133130/).
Eh, I disagree... I saw the cross in his hand at the end as evidence that he did not really renounce personally... but that could just be me.
It's the perfect time for another Star Wars parody

Sigh.... Yeah... Nothing gets past y'all, does it?

That boi is w i d e 
Yea man I only watched it because of driver and it was amazon prime one night I was bored. Totally blew me away. 
I mean I don't think anyone is arguing that it should be illegal to make those complaints, so yeah everyone has a right to their opinion about it. It just doesn't make their opinion any less dumb.
I see, thanks for explaining. I wasn't aware of the full context that the phrase was used in.
> A lot of phrases that might not technically be wrong becomes bad because of its association with certain groups, it is the same reason why "all lives matter" is shitty, because it has been used almost exclusively as a way to shut down black voices talking about the racism they experience. 

Ironically "All Lives Matter" began as a complementary slogan to Black Lives Matter. It's not that problematic on its own, except it wasn't a very long time until it and "Blue Lives Matter" mutated into "White Lives Matter", which kind of revealed the subtext that many people chanting "All Lives Matter" were really trying to say.

Just like how "You will not replace us" went from a dog whistle to the very blatant "Jews will not replace us" in no time at all.
Another example of a phrase like this is "It's ok to be white".

Yeah, no shit it's ok to be white. The problem is the people saying the phrase are implying that white people get routinely discriminated against. If you trying pointing this out to them, suddenly I'm anti-white (I'm white myself so this is dumb as fuck).
Like what?
does it just become a voiceover at that point? i know what you mean but i also don’t know the specific name for it. i was just giving you shit. 
I saw it pretty recently after having heard about it for a while and just damn, such a complicated film but so unbelievably well done... The way it kept ramping up the absurdity to get so real at the end was insane, definitely now one of my favorites too.
Synechdoche was really good yet plain at the same time. Really interesting film.
I don't know why but I could never mesh with each watching i had for Synechdoche, New York. Typically i love creative meta critiques like the movie was but there is this overly pastiche about it for some reason. In a way i tend to imagine that Synechodche, New York was actually a fictional account of the filming of that animated puppet movie Anomalisa
> rough to watch

I know what you mean. But sometimes you come at it while in a different state of mind and it's hilarious (that's not a euphemism for intoxicants). You can interpret it in a very light, breezy way.
Movies rarely have that much of an emotional impact on me, but Synecdoche just hits on a completely different level for me, I absolutely love that movie. 
People who watch films for a living tend to be a bit more passionate about the medium than the average audience member. I've definitely seem a handful of movies that have made me so excited about film that I felt like clapping, but sitting in a normal screening I'd get weird looks for giving a standing ovation. 
No. I'm saying that you never know what you're going to get at Cannes. Even good movies can get boos. But a universal standing ovation usually is a sign of success. Pan's Labyrinth was like this I remember. But for example the Palme winner last year was pretty cooly received by the audience. 
Just seems like a pissy nerd injecting his opinion into the film. Plus it's horribly reasoned.
Try this one.

Well for one thing it's pretty darn dishonest to artificially inflate a movies ticket sales 
Firstly, it's how films and their studios make money on the film, especially opening weekend (and the studio gets a smaller amount each subsequent week, where the theatre keeps that money instead - it's a complicated business model and theatres get shit on a lot, but that's another post).

While it sucks for the filmmakers and the studio to not get their money for that film, it's long-term affects are significantly worse. If enough theatre attendants did what that one did, it would look like stories like Malcolm X were not marketable or cost-effective and those types of stories would be less likely to be made in the future. This theatre attendant may just be one person, but having worked in a theatre, I'm almost certain that theatre attendant deliberately took those sales away from Malcolm X. Our theatre's system went down once, but we could still show movies, so instead of losing money, we had to resort to an older way of keeping track of tickets and concessions and then later when our full power was back on, we'd log those. There's a way to keep track of tickets if your system is down, so I don't buy that guy's excuse.

Of course I've only heard the story anecdotally and wasn't there. For all I know it was just an innocent kid who didn't know any better and only later realized he'd fucked up. I guess we don't really know, but anyway, that's why it's bad.
My god.... We stand before a Titan among men

"Just because you're entitled to it, doesn't mean it isn't stupid"
You should look into the history of the phrase. Pretty interesting stuff. I also appreciate your apparent ability to take in new or different information and opinions. We should all do that. 
The phrase wasn't just popularized by the Klan, but also the Silver Legion and German American Bund, two pro-Nazi social clubs that advocated for the USA to stay out of WWII and maintain relations with Nazi Germany (think the Elks or Rotary, except Fascist). They tried to wrap their fascism up in Christianity, patriotism, and "isolationism" but they really weren't fooling anyone. They were however alarmingly popular, until Pearl Harbor caused their membership to collapse.
It was never complementary; it always meant to undermine the message of BLM, which is that black people are especially targeted by police.
Well wasn't the Square (most recent winner) booed and standing ovation'd simultaneously? I.e. pretty divisive film
Tree of Life got some amount of booing and took the palme.
They booed Okja just because it was a netflix movie. Don't take cannes judgement to the heart. They are too much into their asses to like something different or controvertial. Still, it is a nice place to look to find good movies.
Would probably be called "L cuts" and "J cuts" by editors, but voiceover is probably a better term for every day use.
>Titan

Ben Swolo
Exactly!
I appreciate both of you for this civil and informative exchange.
I actually never knew that it was a phrase that the klan used to say. That actually made me step back for a moment and realize that maybe its modern usage isn't always so innocuous. I think regardless of if you're a Trump supporter or not, knowing the history of this phrase and the connotation it might have for people of color is important. 
>  also the Silver Legion and German American Bund, two pro-Nazi social clubs that advocated for the USA to stay out of WWII and maintain relations with Nazi Germany
