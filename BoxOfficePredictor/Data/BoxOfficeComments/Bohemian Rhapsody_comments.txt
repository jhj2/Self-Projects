Did they just straight up clone Brian May for this? The affectation of his voice is amazing.
There's only room in the band for one hysterical queen.
Synopsis reads:  

*“The film traces the meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound, their near-implosion as Mercury’s lifestyle spirals out of control, and their triumphant reunion on the eve of Live Aid, where Mercury, facing a life-threatening illness, leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music.*

Rami Malek satisfyling looks the part.
I anyone else bugged by the final shot, where the "thump-thump" is playing when the audience claps, and the "clap" plays when they pull their hands apart?

Otherwise, this looks much better than all the rumours and controversy seemed to be leading towards.
I dont see any fat bottomed girls
Ah it seems that Elliot has adopted a 3rd persona
They found the perfect young Brian May. And maybe Freddie too. I like Rami Malek but I can't really imagine him being as sassy as Freddie Mercury. We will see though I hope the movie won't suck.
/r/Queen mod here:

I had to watch this on mute, but what I can say so far is that the movie is definitely going to start from at least the late 60s- you can see the Queen precursor, Smile performing onstage. Queen formed in 1970 after the demise of Smile. (Brian and Roger were in Smile, and Freddie was a fan. Queen went through 3 bassists before recruiting John.)

Still no concrete evidence of the movie portraying anything after the mid 80s, giving some truth to the idea that it's going to end at Live Aid, although the shot of what is probably an emaciated Freddie walking past his cats definitely hints at the last few years of his life.

Edit: Grammar and detail

"You're a legend, Fred."

"We're all legends."

"Yeah, but when they make the movie about us it's still going to pretend that you were the sole genius responsible for the band's success."
As a longtime fan of the band, the line where Freddie responds to "We just need a bit of time" by asking "What if I don't have time?" hit me right in the feels.
It looks like they're getting all of the technical details right and it visually looks really good... But is still all the same Dewey Cox beats that we've all seen before. 

I'm sure the movie will open right before Live Aid, with Freddie all by himself, and someone in the band will be like, "You ready?" And another member will be like "Just hold on. Freddie Mercury needs to think about his entire life before he goes out on stage!"
It looks interesting, if overproduced.

However, the bit at the end where they had the "We Will Rock You" beat playing over people clapping to "Radio Gaga" was mistimed and annoying.
Rami Malek aside, that guy is the spit of young Brian May.
This trailer really puts to rest the rumors that the movie wasn't gonna touch the subjects of Freddie's bisexuality and Aids. It was obviously impossible to make a movie about Freddie Mercury without those two elements.
Its a rock music biopic so the only thing they can do is try to make it fun and interesting w/ good performances and of course highlight the awesome MUSIC. Its prob not going to be some groundbreaking work of cinema
Mr Robot Season 4 looks wild already
This movie will be good, but PG 13 good. In another multiverse Sacha is winning an Oscar for the same movie
One thing I hope this movie does is help introduce casual Queen fans to more of the bands massive catalog of music. If this movie ends up being amazing, Queen could easily gain millions of more die hard fans.
Anyone else think this all looked a bit..cliche?
I'm always going to wonder what it could have been with Sacha Baron Cohen as Freddy, but I guess we will never know. 

I'm definitely going to watch this movie, but I'll still wonder.
It really sucks that Sacha Baron Cohen doomed this movie in a lot of people’s minds before one trailer even came out.

Rami looks fantastic in this and I can’t wait to see it.
Is it just me or this biopic seems oddly strange, considering they are engaging people through Queen's hits, like if that was a distraction? It feels stylish, yeah, but flat.
Brian May is spot on!
Very excited, huge Queen fan. 

The actor playing Brian May is spot on. Malek's accent as Freddie could be better, but I'm excited to see how well he does the role of Mercury. 

One thing I'm very looking forward for is Freddie's relationship with Mary Austin. Sure, he was gay, but she was the person he consiered the love of his life. She was his true friend, and I can't wait to see how they pull it off. 

Another thing I'm looking forward is seen QUEEN as a band. Mercury might have been the driving force, and the one thing people are most excited to see. But Queen wasn't Freddie and some other guys. They were Brian May, Roger Taylor, John Deacon, and Freddie Mercury. They all contributed equally to the success of the band and were just as important to the band as Mercury was. 
Im much more confident in Rami Malek now. He sounds almost exactly like mercury.
What I learned on Reddit today is: I know nothing about Queen and Queen still has a strong fan base. 

This is why I like Reddit. 
I dont get why they were so keen on getting rid of the ugly parts of the band history in making it family friendly. I went to a concert (Adam Lambert singing) and they swore a decent amount, made sex jokes and had an entire original song called "I dont really give two fucks" with rainbows and stuff on the videoboard.

I wish theyd make a legitimate and true movie about the band. Rockstars arent family friendly and I wish they would portray that.
Gives me goosebumps just watching the trailer!  I really hope this movie is as good as it looks.
Lord Jesus and Freddy in heaven please let this be a good movie. 
Been waiting for this for so long!
I'm not feeling optimistic about this. Everyone has all these badass phrases. Seems kinda boring and precisely what Freddie Mercury didn't want.
Even if this movie turns out to be bad the soundtrack will be great.
I think it's clear from all the work they've put into this that we are going to see Malek's very best come through. Think for a minute about how tough a job this is to PLAY FREDDIE MERCURY: You're playing the best rock singer to have ever lived. You're not playing Stephen Hawking, a man whose job had nothing to do with acting, you're playing a man whose very job as a frontman uses nearly the same damn skillset that yours as an actor requires (flash, bravura, vocal power, communication of emotion, poise, physicality, charm), and, to make it even more challenging, Freddie was a grandmaster at the very skills you're trying to bring to bear on representing him. It's like trying to play Usain Bolt, but to play him you actually have to beat (or at least equal) his time: a very tall order indeed. I'm not saying Remi Malek can't be judged as having fallen short, but when assessing his performance, you might consider that he was up against a man who could overwelm 72,000 people at once (live aid) with his unparalelled gifts. A man that we're still astonished by regularly 45 years down the line. A man who defines the very terms: Superstar and Rock God.
https://i.imgur.com/pHQLw3g.gif  
We will we will rock you 🤘  
Casting director needs a pat on the back. 
Eeeeeeeeeek. I think Rami Malek is going to slay this role. Can't wait. 
I remember the movie made about " The Doors" and how epic it was when it first came out. I love " the doors" and " Queen" I hope this one delivers like the Doors movie did. 
This movie looks super, super cheesy. 
Anyone else have trouble with Malek as Mercury after seeing Sacha Baron Cohen done up for the roll?
I could swear the last scene where the people are clapping is Radio Gaga, not We Will Rock You.
As good as this movie looks, I can't help but wonder how much better it would've been had Sasha Baron Cohen gotten his way.
Honestly, I don't see Freddie. I just see Remi Malek in a Freddie costume. It looks like a well made film, but Remi isn't selling me on Freddie, and that's sort of the crux of what this needed to be. My interest wanes.
People hating on the fact that it doesn't address his "flamboyant lifestyle" need to research this man. He had 1 true love. And it was a woman. He talked about her all the time and gave the reason for his success to her. 
The man was clearly gay. But he loved that woman. That woman is Mary Austin. 


I am beyond stoked to see this film. Watch Rami Malek do the Bohemian Rhapsody scene from Wembley. it's on YouTube. This man hits every note and his performance is a mirror image on The Legend. 
They got Freddie’s cats! 
It still wierds me out to see Mr Robot playing such an outgoing role....
He's so effin' good!
OHHHHHH MAMA MIA MAMA MIA MAMA MIA 
Bonsoir Elliot!
I actually thought it was Brian May's voice at first.
They freaking nailed the casting for Brian. You could close your eyes and totally believe that it's actually Brian talking. They cast Roger perfectly as well. 

I do wish they would have had Malek work on Freddie's speaking voice a little more but I totally understand that Freddie's accent was pretty unique, predominately English with remnants of an Indian accent.
Guess the actor better go get a PhD. now.
It's uncanny
and Historical Queen 
I desperately want that to be a real quote. 
That line makes no sense. Freddy wasn’t out to the band at that point.
> where Mercury, facing a life-threatening illness, leads the band in one of the greatest performances in the history of rock music.

I thought he wasn't diagnosed until 87?
So...every rock band/Star biopic ever.  
  
I’m still in but it’s just always the same damn story. 
I was worried after Sacha Baron Cohen pulled out of the movie, saying that Queen wanted the movie to focus less on Freddie and more on the band moving "from strength to strength" after Mercury's death (yeah, I know). 

This trailer, however, relieves my fears. It looks spectacular, there's a massive Freddie focus and the they've nailed the accents beautifully. I can't wait to see my childhood brought to life! 
Looks like in that scene they actually were clapping for radio gaga even, not we will rock you, and just chose to play we will rock you over the scene just for the trailer. Visually I thought it was creative, and it worked generally well from that standpoint.
That’s actually how Queen concerts go. You gotta watch the actual Live Aid performance though.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=A22oy8dFjqc

Rock You starts at 16:03, but I suggest you watch the whole thing.
Looks like they'll actually get into Freddie Mercury's drug addiction, the fact that he was gay and his death via AIDS.

Edit: He was bi? I thought he was gay. TIL
It is actually a true representation of how concerts are in terms of how sound travels. The further back in the crowed you go, the more delayed the sound it. Not to say that I don't find it jarring in the final shot. It is jarring. But it is also accurate.
Brian May married a slender actress. Don't count on it.
Probably off riding their bikes.
well it was the 1980’s so being a fat bottom girl then meant instead of having a line shaped you slightly curved line shaped butt
Wow Tyrell's definitely going to fall for this one
Lol brah...no one can be as sassy as Freddie. 
I hope so too.  
(Crossing fingers)  

I have a feeling It'll be one of those performances where the actor who's playing a person in real life, wouldn't be the natural choice for that role.  Then you see the movie, and the actor is so convincing that you forget it's not the real person.

For example:  
Kurt Russel as Coach Herb Brooks, in *Miracle*.  
I was thinking, "*Captain Ron* is playing Herb Brooks?"

   Kurt nailed it.
Am I the only way who thinks his accent just sounds weird and way off?
I thought Brian May was pretty clear that this was ending at Live Aid. It may hint at his disease around Live Aid, which I think he knew at that point something was wrong. He had actually been sick for the few days leading up to the performance and was advised not to perform. 

Edit: still very much looking forward to this, I am excited.
Do you know if they have Marc Martell doing any part in the vocal mixing? Im sure they have plently audio of Freddys singing and speaking. But Im sure Marc would have plently benifits with any neccessary sound mixing and help bridge the gap between Rami and Freddy.
Are you excited for this movie?

I know a lot of people were upset when the Sasha Baron Cohen version didn't work. Curious what your overall take is.
Why did you watch on mute? Work? Or don’t like song mashups?
I feel like I just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes.
Seems they're making it so "We Will Rock You" is written in like...1982? Or they made Freddie grow his moustache in freaking 1976/1977 in this film?! 

Because in the bit where Brian is talking about recording a song the audience can perform - you have 1977 John, Brian and Roger and an extremely out of place 1980s Freddie Mercury.

It was bad enough to have Freddie crowd-surf and put "Fat Bottomed Girls" and "39" in a 1974 setlist. I was willing to look the other way, though. But at this point, too many liberties are being taken.

The most abhorrent of which - in the film, Freddie gets diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1984. Which would've severely altered the timeline of 1984-1991 Queen.

But as for the out of place '80s Freddie in 1977 - is it that we just can't go without moustache for too long into the film? Fuck, sometimes I'm surprised the band and collective media hasn't PhotoShopped a moustache onto every pre-1980 and post-1986 Freddie photo.

Seeing as I prefer Queen and Freddie in the '70s and '89-'91 both image and music - this bugs me a lot. Freddie had other looks, people!

I was excited that this film would represent the other "looks" Freddie had boldly for the majority of the film. But it seems like that was changed to bring in moustache-Freddie.
In a thread seemingly full of naysayers I'm very happy to see someone else as excited about this movie as I am.
This comment needs so much more appreciation. I completely agree with every point you made. Nobody would have wanted cameras in the room during his final days in real life so why would it be any different when making a film. 
I don't even play any instruments, or pretend that I know a lot about music, but even for a regular guy like me, it is abundantly clear how amazing the instrumentation in queen songs are. It is abundantly clear that that, along with the beautiful harmonizing in a lot of their songs, was something that made Queen a band that was OBVIOUSLY very collaborative. I'm not even saying that as someone who considers myself a knowledgeable snob. I'm just some guy, and I can tell that, so it's all the more absurd that the others are getting the shaft. 
only band where all members have written number 1 songs
 Apparently Sasha Baron Cohen's take was already too Freddycentric for the band. 
Malek going for the Oscar.

Edit : He just won. 
I teared up at this cheesy trailer I'm going to fucking sob at the movie. 
I’m a super emotional right now, and the line made me tear up so much. 
"I also...I write songs."

"Our lead singer just punched his landlord while he got the laryngitis."

"Then you'll need someone new."
Well you can officially clap yourself on the back for this prediction. 
Yeah, that last scene just looked very dumb
Yeah I think that's just an editing concession someone made for the trailer. I wouldn't expect to see that in the movie.
It proves they're touched on, remains to be seen how far they go with it though. 
I mean it's just basic screenplay writing, the deepest low in the band's career (aside from Freddie's illness) was when they made Hot Space in 84 because Freddie's 'assistant' thought they should make music that could be played in gay clubs. Which was followed by their highest point in their career, their Live Aid show and subsequent stadium tour in 86. That's a third act that pretty much writes itself.
The mixes for the trailers have been a joy to listen to, and the shots for the trailers have been rather pretty.

I expect this movie to be a great visual and auditory candy. Mmm I'm gonna get diabetes from that if the movie looks and sounds as good as it is here.
Yeah just something kinda fun to watch. 
They actually time traveled
Queen is one of my favorite bands because it has something for all fans of almost every type of rock. If you've only heard their most famous songs (which are still mostly genius), you're missing out massively.
I feel like almost all biopics feel this way. The best ones are where a few week or month snapshot is taken. It's just too hard to cram that much life into a couple hours.
Yeah, it looks like a commercial for Queen's Greatest Hits crossed with a really well-shot "Drunk History."
It looks like a made for TV special
Looks kinda sugarcoated honestly..
The fact that they had to jam all of Queen’s largest hits in one trailer seems conspicuously like a tool to distract you from the movie they actually made.
Did anyone expect anything more? All biopic are pretty predictably constructed these days.
Perhaps but it looks visually fantastic & I love Rami enough that I'm going to let myself be excited. Just not *too* excited. 
It's a Freddie Mercury biopic. I'm not sure how you could expect it to be anything other than the cheesiest thing ever put to film.
Dewey Cox has ruined all music biopics for me. 

*The wrong kid died!*
every biopic looks the same. promising start, early drugs, more fame, the highest heights with the lowest of drugs, the triumphant return

thought they died off with the dewey cox story. early 2000s was full of the same story with a different artist
No. The advertisements in this advertisement said it's not as bad as we were expecting.
Not sure why you're being downvoted, the film would have been better with him. The reason he was dropped was that he was trying to make it a film about Mercury's life and how extravagant his life was. The band wanted it to be about them and only the good things about them.
Does he do his own singing?
It's not like they are one of most popular bands of so time it anything....
Yeah man, Queen will have diehard fans for a long time. My mom and I have almost zero music in common, but one of the things we bonded over when I was growing up was Queen.
I saw them about a year ago and while Lambert himself admitted during the show that he knows he's not Freddie, he does a very good job. 
Not camp enough for Freddie's taste.

Where's the razzle-dazzle? Where's the Magic!
/r/noisygifs
Eh. Cohen was probably too old for the role anyway. 

But the rumoured reasons for him not wanting to be involved seem to be bearing fruit in this trailer. It looks heavily romanticised.
>People hating on the fact that it doesn't address his "flamboyant lifestyle" need to research this man.

Truth. The band members have said many times that offstage, Freddie was shy and introverted. 
The look of the band members also seems to be pretty spot on
Not just Indian but Parsi, remnants of Zoroastrian diaspora into India. Very specific mixture into his way of speaking. 
> I do wish they would have had Malek work on Freddie's speaking voice a little more but I totally understand that Freddie's accent was pretty unique, predominately English with remnants of an Indian accent.

I'm in the same boat. When I heard Malek was getting cast as Freddie I thought it was the absolute best possible fit among current actors. 

But.... In the trailer, he's kinda sorta the least believable one of them all. Maybe it's because it's damn near impossible to replicate Freddie Mercury, but idk, it just wasn't the *perfect* casting that I expected. I'll wait until I actually see the movie to criticize too much, though. 


Sasha baron Cohen would of made this the best bio flick in history. Dude looks like him already and I know he would of nailed the accent and voice. 


And be freaking head of Astronomy.
I'll be heartbroken if '39 doesn't make it into the movie (which it probably won't)
And Killer Queen
Of course it isn’t. Freddy wasn’t out at that point.
Was Freddy ever officially gay? I always heard it was more that his sexual preference was yes.
From the couple interviews I've seen, it definitely feels like a joke he would have made regardless of who knew his sexuality.
Maybe they're trying to emphasize that he was sick at that point? Even if he wasn't diagnosed until 87, when do they think he contracted it? Even if no one, not even Freddie, knew he was suffering from it at the time, it's super impressive in hindsight to know that he was already ill yet could give that great of a performance.
Likely one of many reasons sacha baron Cohen left the movie. It’s a family friendly Queen promotion movie. Not a Freddie Mercury movie. All the interesting bits are being scrubbed out because a rock star’s life is unsurprisingly full of adult content
Yeah, they're clearly gonna fudge the timeline for the sake of the drama. Which, fair enough, it's a pretty typical thing to do for a biopic.
Was he not sick before he was diagnosed?
He probably had contracted HIV several years earlier, so it’s accurate.
> where Mercury, facing a life-threatening illness

What illness? I hope he's cured by the end of the movie. But please don't spoile it for me 

(/s of course)
Walk Hard has ruined the musician bioflick for me forever
*That Thing You Do!* is the best band/biopic ever. I don't even care that it's not a real band. 
Yeah I think it was done on purpose to create that visual dichotomy.  
It's literally what the audience was doing to We Will Rock You

https://youtu.be/A22oy8dFjqc?t=967

He's even wearing the same outfit.
Green Day has been playing Bohemian Rhapsody before their concerts  for the last year.  The crowd goes nuts.  And this is just a recording playing with no one on stage.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZnBNuqqz5g

Damn!  I never realized how good he sounded live.
Greatest performance ever.
I love the analysis in the description about each song. Fascinating!
eh, kinda.  It looks like the crowd is more following the 1-2-3 rhythm of the song getting all three beats with clapping.  The trailer shows Clap-Clap-<hold> when the soundtrack is going <stomp><stomp><clap>. 
He was bi, not gay. Just FYI. 
Dig Dug is no fucking joke. I can't even have a classic games compilation disc in my house. 
I'm homeless, in gay, I have AIDS, and I'm *new* in town
I'd just like to clarify that Freddie Mercury wasn't gay, he was bisexual. Bi men aren't too common, but that doesn't mean they're all just gay.

edit: openly bi men aren't common. There's plenty of bi men who pass as either just straight or gay.
\*Bisexual
>"Another day, another dug."

>- Korg

- Freddie Mercury. 
*He lied to us.*
To a night at the opera?
not a lot of thicc going around with all that coke
I'm as gay as a daffodil, my dear!
Idk man, if they gave it to Sacha like the original plan I think he woulda done way better embodying the sass and grit of Freddie
I'm glad someone else sees Kurt Russell solely as Captain Ron.
Watch interviews of freddie, malek is doing a pretty damn good job based on this trailer. It does not by any means sound "way off." 
Captures the essence of Mercury quite well to be honest. Try watching some Mercury interviews. There are not many but they will give you a pretty good idea of how he speaks
Completely. I would have put this down to just yet another bad attempt at a British accent except Rami Malek does a fine one in Night at the Museum.
I can't remember where I read this but he actually had nodules on his throat during that performance. What is astounding is his ability to hit the notes he is hitting whilst under what was no doubt an excruciating amount of pain. I'll see if I can dredge it up but maybe one of the more well versed redditors can find the post. 

Edit: I found the video, it wasn't a post. Doesn't have many views but I loved it when I watched it;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQbFyYXh9ug
Wait so why did SBC leave if they were ending it after live aid anyway? 
How much time was there in between Live Aid and the Wembley shows?
Hearing this makes me feel about 50/50 on this. 

I am a huge Queen fan, but with all the leadup to this flick with SBC and such, I'm sorta conflicted. 

On one hand, I think it's insulting to the memory of Freddie to not reinact his death. Mourn it all you like, but it happened. To pretend it didn't happen just feels insulting. 

On the other hand, though, I'd rather they end the movie on Live Aid, argubally their most famous live performance, instead of the original plan of dragging it past his death and being like "Dude Queen is still around and kicking ass!" (Which let's get real, Queen without Freddie is a meer shell of what it was, you can't replace him in the slightrst). 

I'm still gonna see it but I'm gonna be skeptical walking in 
Hopefully it shows his relationship with Seamus / James, they loved each other very much
Yeah maybe after Cohen went on Stern and said the band wanted half the movie to be about them carrying on valiantly after Freddy’s death, they realized how stupid that was. I’m pretty sure the internet’s reaction was overwhelmingly negative to that concept
The producer has claimed that Marc is involved in the vocal side.
There have been rumblings, but we haven't heard him yet
It's probably the biggest Queen related thing to happen in my lifetime, so it's difficult not to be really hyped!

I was excited to see what Sacha would do with the role, but I have a lot of belief and respect in Rami, and the trailers are only strengthening that.

I'll reserve full judgement for after I've seen it ^^^8 ^^^times, but from what I've seen so far, I'm optimistic.
Before this trailer I would have loved Sasha Baron Cohen to have played this role, but Rami Malek absolutely owned it in this trailer, far beyond anything I could have imagined.
Work! Queen mashups are best mashups!
I know what you mean! Hopefully they'll include a lot of the legendary stories like the Death on Two Legs vengeance, and David Bowie
In the trailer's defense, it isn't like we don't know how this story plays out. I'm hoping there's a lot of substance to the parts they didn't show.
You could say that about any biopic. All you need to do is just read their Wikipedia entry.
This is a trailer. How do you know any of this is the case in the final film??
[deleted]
I saw a documentary on Queen the other day that really brought out how important all of them were to their success. Freddy's unique stage presence was what made them famous initially, but the fact that all of them brought in unique song ideas was the reason they kept reinventing themselves and stayed on top of the game for as long as they did.
Brian May is every bit a genius at what he does as Mercury was at what he did.
FFS the movie isn't even out yet
Cohen wanted to make a Freddie Mercury film, Queen wanted to make a Queen film. Hopefully he gets his way too someday.
If he wins an Oscar, I hope that Cohen dressed as Kanye West storms the stage and says that Sasha Baron Cohen deserved the Oscar for best performance of all time that never happened.
this is the movie that will transform Rami to a movie star 
when bohemian rhapsody wins the GG for best motion picture comedy or musical  whose going to walk up on stage and accept ?
Well, if they want to be true to Freddie Mercury's life, then they probably won't go very far with it because Freddie was very secretive with his personal life. He never actually admitted to being bi, though he didn't deny it either. As for the Aids, he actually denied having Aids literally until the day before he died. 
Only touching, no penetration though
What songs/albums would you recommend to a rudimentary Queen listener? 
That "Steve Jobs" movie with Fassbender was amazing because of exactly that. It showed him at three different stages of his life and gave us short glimpses into those phases. You had to fill in the gaps yourself.
I'm Not There (the Bob Dylan biopic) might be the must uncliche movie you ever watch.

Love and Mercy (Brisn Wilson biopic) is also pretty good 
Drunk History are surprisingly well shot considering what they are.
Old white executive: Noone will ever listen to Queen!
That's because it will be. My rather lame convo topic of choice recently has been this movie and Sacha Baron Cohen leaving it, and why he did! I initially really agreed with him in that it's a shame not to show the dark side of Freddie, and really go for the gold in the writing and story line. At the same time Queen were quite a close band, and the members kept Freddie's secret about his illness for years at his request and kept making music. It allowed him to pass as he wanted - telling the world only the day before he died. The fact they did that and kept going gives them some agency for sure in how the movie is made to me. 

They want to keep the image of Freddie that Freddie always wanted out there alive. I love Queen and Freddie Mercury, I would have LOVED to see Cohen play the dark elements, but I can't lie and say I'm not excited for a cheesy celebration of Queen. The trailer got me really pumped! 
Ah, the Suicide Squad technique...
I can’t believe those bastards put Queen songs in a trailer for a movie about Queen. Shameless attempt to get Queen fans to watch this Queen movie. Is this late capitalism?
Get On Up, if you haven't seen it, is a pretty unique take on the biopic.
Sacha Baron Cohen had an idea.
Mercury wanted his life to be about only the good things, and never about the AIDS. That's why he told the world the day before he died. The band knew for years that he was sick and dying. I guess it;s hard for them to let go of what he wanted, that must have been a tough secret to keep and record through. 
That's exactly what I read, and I feel like Sacha was right in dipping out. It sounded like they were baiting the audience with a Freddy Mercury movie and then giving them a Queen Movie.
> the film would have been better with him

You have no evidence of this being true.
He wanted the movie to be about sex and drugs and have the music play a lesser role.
I think he would have been perfect playing Freddie, but as a Queen fan I also have no interest in watching his version of the movie.
I meant that he talks exactly like mercury. I think they are doing a mix of rami and freddies singing.
Yeah lol I'm not sure what he's saying. Just because you don't know a group, doesn't mean they don't have a strong fan base. ???
you want NSFW trailer 
I think the real Roger Taylor is prettier than movie Roger Taylor, but that's just me. 
Plus he had about forty extra teeth in his mouth, which probably accounts for something.
Also, we know Freddie SO SO much better than we do the others. I've watched 500 times more interview footage of Freddie than any other frontman, let alone any other bandmate.
His lisp from the dental prosthesis is bothering me. 
Sascha Baron Cohen would have been miles better. 
I don't know, I'm torn. I think SBC would have pulled off 1980+ Freddie really well, but not so much the long hair, clean shaven Freddie of pre 1980, and it seems like the film focuses quite a bit on that part of his career. Rami Malek is quite convincing as early-days Freddie, but in the footage of the replication of Live Aid, he looks straight up goofy. He looks more like a caricature of Freddie than the real thing. 

It's tricky, because once Freddie cut his hair and donned the moustache, he not only looked like a totally different person, but his stage persona was markedly different. Take that with the HUGE difference in Freddie's onstage persona vs interview persona vs just being himself with his buddies (which can be seen in some candid footage on YouTube) and it's almost like you have to play five completely different people to get Freddie right. 
They could just do a Beatles sequence with an animated cartoon featuring near lightspeed travel.

Or throw in Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway.

Also... fie-fo the Black Queen
True, he never put a label on it. By todays standards he would be considered bi or pan. But point is at this time he was presumed straight and definitely wouldn't have been so open about not being straight.
No, everything must be for evil reasons!
It's almost positive he got the disease during the recording of "Hot Space", in Germany. Brian himself explained that Mercury met a gay community (and a wild all-out party one) for the first time in his life. I suddenly understood why the disk came out like it did lol.

But the diagnosis I have no idea.
I'm a Queen fan in the smallest sense of the word. I basically can't even name any of the band members outside of Brian May and Freddie Mercury. 

What are some of the things that Cohen wanted to put into the movie that the rest of the band scrubbed out? 
Which exactly the reason why I’m worried about the film. I’d prefer a more character study film into Freddie Mercury over the story about Queen, since Mercury was the driving force. This film is probably going to be read like a fan wiki page than a deep inner look into Freddie Mercury 
I'm getting kind of tired of people automatically jumping to make this criticism. Cohen left the project two years ago at this point, we have no idea how many changes (for better or worse) have been made since then. While you may very well be right and they completely neuter Mercury's story, let's wait until the reviews come out at least before we jump to conclusions.
Didn't the trailer feature a microphone surrounded by lines of coke? I think there might be some adult content in this movie.
This comment really makes no sense in the context of what you are replying too. Did you even read their comment or just wanted to copy and paste the same comment everybody has seen so many times in regards to this film that you replied to any comment with it, The comment you are replying to is literally about Freddie's AIDS in the film and you're replying saying the film won't even include things like AIDS. Like what are you doing?
Usually I can understand, but this such a gross misinterpretation of what actually happened. How is this not insulting to Freddie's legacy? 
Because it's a biopic not a documentary.

Just look at a "beautiful mind" the guy it's based on doesn't have visual hallucinations, his are auditory. 
Usually the way it works. I've seen every episode of House... so I'm basically a doctor.
Someone once narrowed it down to the few weeks prior to his appearance on SNL, which would have been late summer in 1982.
Wrong kid died!
In my dreams I'm blowin' you... kisses.
God damn this is a dark point in my life!
And you never once paid for drugs
In the original concert they're doing three claps - one for each "thump" and then one for the "clap".  

In the trailer, they're doing two claps, and they're only on the "thumps".
That video seems sped up for some reason, or is it just me?  
Haha this one Youtube Comment

>Freddie still make the best concerts even w the huge disavantage of be dead for 25 years..﻿
Could you imagine having this kind of an impact with your life? That’s fucking insane
That was amazing! Thank you for linking the videos, made my day :)

I love the people singing the guitar solos! 
That gave me chills. 
I think there are several bands that play this song before they come out.
I love this.

kinda lame but when I first saw the 1st link on facebook, I got super emotional from it. 
My favorite Queen album is *Live From Montreal*. His voice is fucking incredible.
[deleted]
One day (and night) I went down rabbit hole after rabbit hole looking up old bands and their performances. Some were pretty good (Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix) some were pretty bad (Beattles, Elvis- no offense to them but it was just audiences fucking screaming the whole time). I found myself totally fascinated by Queen. That shit was on a whole other level. I had no feelings about the band either way before I started but holy shit those performances will blow your hair back!
I finally watched this a couple of years ago on Youtube and thought “Holy shit we lost a legendary showman. At least we still have Prince and Bowie.”

Bowie died the next day :( 
Yeah! Two thumbs up for this!!!!!
No, he was addicted to golden retrievers. 
My life has been ruined by dig dug. I lost my wife and kids
Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs 
IIRC his long term girlfriend was Mary Austin and he was living with her at the end and bequeathed his estate to her and their cats.  I'm not saying he wasn't gay.  He just got together with her in the early 70s/late 60s and his relationship with her lasted beyond his coming out.
Bisexual men are likely very common, but its 'easier' for them to just say they are straight and never admit to being bisexual so they never come out. A TON of older bisexual men who come out of the closet later in life say stuff along the lines of "I was attracted to both men and women, so I just stuck with women and never admitted I was also attracted to men. If I was gay, I would have no choice but to admit it, but I had another option for me romantically" 

Hence why so many bisexual men never come out of the closet. If you are already attracted to girls, you can just stick with that, and never have to admit your also attracted to men. Gay men don't have that. Its either admit you are gay, or never truly have a romantic life. 
Never trust a chorus.
On a seaside rendezvous
Oh man I wish I didn’t know this, that would’ve been so much better. Malek has the look but the voice and accent seem so off to me. Sounds like Brad Pitt from Troy.
There’s more body mass in Sacha as well. Remi is a really skinny guy—not very reminiscent of pre-HIV Freddie.
I always sort of thought Borat and Freddie looked similar lol
IDK man https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wk9hPubD1Q
Do yourself a favor and watch some interviews of Freddie. You'll find Malek is doing a pretty damn good job, based on this trailer alone. 

>except Rami Malek does a fine one in Night at the Museum.

I'll pick "Indicators that I'm probably wrong" for $500, Alex. 
Aren't there thousands of different British accents? It might be hard to narrow down a different one. 
That's because Freddie was born and raised from a young age in Zanzibar and is of Parsi descent. Before moving to England.

His accent wasn't typical by any means.
Supposedly he had nodules going back to their first tour of the USA in 1975 and decided not to get them removed, scared he would ruin his voice. Elton John suffered from a similar problem in the 80s, and had to get surgery which resulted in his voice changing dramatically after 87.
You can still hear it, though. Listen to the LiveAid version of Bohemian Rhapsody - he hits every note that he goes for, but most of it's about half an octave lower than than the recorded version, and he cuts off the "mama, ooo-ooo-oooh" about halfway through the long note.

Don't get me wrong, they absolutely blew every other band that performed that day out of the fucking water, and Freddie was on *fire*, but his voice was noticeably not at its best IMO.
I'm pretty sure one the original drafts/ideas presented to SBC was that Freddie was going to die halfway through the movie and the other half would be about the band dealing with the loss and getting back on stage blah blah
We'll probably never know for sure, but all the hints seem to be that SBC was being a diva and wasn't getting his way. SBC claims that he left because the band wanted the film to be about them after Freddie died and how they overcame the tragedy - which seems like complete nonsense. It's all a case of he said/she said now, so it all comes down to who you believe.
From what I understand in veiled posts by Brian May is that he was a bit difficult to work with as they put the story together. To be honest, I think Rami Malek is a much better actor anyway.
Bear in mind that a film can change a *lot* during the process of making it - there may have been a version of it in it's early days that fit SBC's description and that caused him to leave, but as the production has gone on it's morphed into something more like what he would have preferred.
Live Aid was in summer 1985 (June?)... The famous Queen Wembley shows are in July 1986
I don't think it's insulting to not show his death. It's one thing to flat out pretend like it didn't happen, but it's another to focus on his life and achievements instead and remember him for how he wanted to be remembered (Freddie was an intensely private person after all; he didn't even announce he was ill until the day before he died.)
Freddie told Jim Beach before he died that he never wanted to be boring. While a rock bio is sort of a boring way of portraying him, I think reenacting his death is a bit unnecessary, imo. We don't need to mourn him, but to continue to celebrate his life. 
[deleted]
You can't fit the entire history of Queen and Freddie into a single movie. If this movie is about his life and not his death, then that's great. If someone makes a movie about his death, that's great too.
I think it's a better choice to end at Live Aid, rather than continue to the death and beyond. The audience walking in to the film already knows he died, and they've already got pretty significant opinions about the band post-Freddy. This is a much better choice than the original script that killed Freddy halfway through the movie, and spent the remainder focusedon Queen continuing without him.   
Dramatically, it's a much better bio-pic if it ends on a high note. Look at Walk the Line, it ends with the Cashes agreeing to get married, not June dying and Johnny dealing with it. Look at Ray, it ends with him kicking his drug habit and performing George On My Mind after Georgia adopts it as the state song. A biopic should show us intimacy of the subjects life, not their death. 
Meh- I love SBC, and I LOVE Queen- and I wanted to see him portray Freddie, but that ship has sailed. 

I hope this movie is entertaining, and I’m pulling for Rami to nail it. 
Ever since I saw Sacha in Hugo I always thought he should have played Freddie.

He looks just like him and he has the chops to play him correctly.


[deleted]
I think SBC is more charismatic, but Mr. Robot has shown that Malek is just a better actor.
Correct! I think you’ll like the mashup in the trailer!
[deleted]
from someone whos been listening to queen for years but dont know much about their story, whats the Death on two legs and how was bowie involved?
Agreed. It did get me hyped but I at least STILL want some surprises on what topics are covered in it, lol
How do I know what?

-I know that they put "Fat Bottomed Girls"/"39" in 1974 because promotional photos showed them on the setlists for a 1974 show in the film. "Fat Bottomed Girls" didn't come out until 1978 and "39" wasn't performed live until 1976.

-I know that Freddie (in the film) is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1984 because the synopsis even says it, as well as Freddie's personal manager when asked about it in interviews. This is wildly inaccurate as it wasn't known to Freddie that he had HIV until 1987.

-Freddie never crowdsurfed - I know that because even Brian May stated as such when he said Rami did it spontaneously and they kept it in regardless of it not being true to Freddie's character.

-"We Will Rock You" was written and recorded in 1977. In the trailer, you can clearly see 1977-era John Deacon and Roger Taylor. Also the extras are in 1970s era clothing. Yet...Freddie Mercury - who didn't grow a moustache or cut his hair until 1980 - is clearly out of place sporting his 1980-1986 moustache/short hair.

That's how I know.
Yep.

They all, individually, have written number 1 hits. 

They also were amazing in other areas. Brian May built his guitar (aside from being an astrophysicist); Deacon was an engineer who built his own pedals. Etc
Seriously omg. He wrote quite a few of Queen's more popular songs
Robert Plant.
Ian Anderson.
That's what's so sad about the hysteria,  Freddie wanted to be seen as more than his sexuality yet people want to focus on that still to this day.  
My two favorite songs that none of my friends know are Hammer to Fall and White Queen.

My favorite album other than Night at the Opera is A Day at the Races.

It's really cool to listen to Queen's super early stuff and see how they evolved.
The accents are usually better than Rami's too.
I think that was meant to be Jeff Lynn. Looks pretty spot on if it is.
Band is traveling on a bus after recording a song. Super surprised to see a huge crowd of fans - \*Freddie Wake up. You gotta see this! \*Leave me alone.\* No look. They open a window and the crowd sings their latest song. \*AMAZED\* 
So that’s it, huh? We’re some kind of music band?
Which used a Queen song.
The band is still touring. They don't want 2018's scrutiny aimed at their 70's cocaine midget debauchery parties.
Also people are sleeping on Rami, dude is a great actor.
This place is an echo chamber, everyone here is Steven Spielberg
No one's given a reason, which leads me to speculate the sole reason is "He was famous for playing a dude with a moustache. Therefore, he would have been better!" 
As well as Marc Martel singing too, apparently 
not just you. Roger is a really good looking man, and the guy in the movie is just average
I believe Malek just has a slight lisp. I’m a big fan of Mr. Robot (though I’ve yet to watch S3) and it’s there too. 
I bet he would have nailed the accent.
[Hey they did that with Bob Dylan.](https://youtu.be/MFUEofAr9GA)
* **CLICK** * 
I did an RPG setting once in the Mercurial Lands of Rhye, and the king's throne had been split among three warring queens: Black, White, and Killer.
As if the Germans didn’t have enough to feel guilty about 
From what I've read he expected the movie to be about Mercury whereas the movie was going to be about the band, and the rest in the aftermath, and ignores a lot of the R-rated stuff that happened like the parties with waiters walking around with platters of coke, Freddie standing all balconies yelling at construction men that whoever had the biggest dick should come up, etc.
IIRC he supposedly wanted to really emphasize Freddie's sexual relationships with men. He also wanted the movie to be more about Freddie than the entire band.
Watch this interview https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-M4JA3fIU
I remember him mentioning something like an orgy and a midget walking around with a platter of coke on his head.
Gay nudity to start with. Probably also the degradation of the psyche and body as the illness progresses. 

Ever seen that picture with Diana and the aids patient? Imagine a movie portraying "the great Freddy Mercury!" as a desicated husk. 
I have read that freddie dies halfway through the movie and the rest is about the band after his death, which apparently Sasha want happy about.
[deleted]
>Mercury was the driving force.

Not really.  although Freddy was very flamboyant and all; he was known really as the lead singer of Queen.. nothing more or less.

He tried to branch out on under his own name and released a few songs.. and it was a disaster.!

The whole dynamics are very interesting, Queen was not much without Freddy and Freddy wasn't much without Queen either.
Oh it definitely is
Because real life is messy and doesn't follow the neat patterns of the [five-act structure](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/into-the-woods-excerpt/421566/), screenwriters often rearrange things to fit the needs of the story. You can't afford to be precious about these things; film-making isn't about documentary truth, it's about narrative/thematic truth.
HIV can incubate for as long as 5 years. I’m assuming that will be taken advantage of, or mentioned, in the film to justify the time difference.
It's the devil's music! *barfs violently*
You’re not half the boy Nate was! You’re not even half the boy that the *top* half of Nate was!
You can always come.....in my back door!! 
I just want to beat off... all my demons
That's what I was just thinking. Thousands of people have come to see a completely different band and the intro to the entire evening is the crowd singing along to one of *your* songs. I couldn't even begin to imagine how surreal something like this must feel. 
Did it make it a Green Day?
Seems like a good choice to get the crowd dynamic flowing.
That is a really good one!! Years ago they were playing it on Ovation or something. I felt so lucky to see it. I also like on YouTube seeing their really early concerts where Freddie would hit the high notes live. His voice was one of a kind. 
But Prince is ok, right? 
you need to stop fucking talking right meow.
So it's YOUR fault!
The next day :(
There's hope, man. My dad kicked his Pong addiction two years before he passed at 73. It's never too late to just put the quarters down and change.
So I shouldn't plan to be rocked?
I just hope the movie turns out to be at least better than my low expectation. After they dropped Sacha because they wanted a more family friendly movie, I lost most faith.
Supergreg is his late 90s/early 00s Slavic Freddie impersonation 
Freddie was born and raised from a young age in modern day Zanzibar to Parsi parents before moving to England. So his accent wasn't really one you'd find on the U.K. islands.
it was also said that he did not fix his teeth due to the same reason, he was afraid that it will change his voice
Wow- I didn’t know that about Elton. That’s gotta be crazy scary because your voice is your livelihood. I felt terrible for Adele, she seemed psyched to perform at Wembly and had to cancel it because she needed surgery. 
Julie Andrews too. It didn't ruin her voice, but it definitely took her from extraordinary and recognizable to run of the mill pleasant sounding. 
Didn't realise Elton John was that old 
Yup. Elton's nodules developed during the American leg of his 1986 tour, which ended in September, then he went down to Australia to do a massive tour with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. His got so bad he had to cancel his first show. In his 16 years of performing at that point, he never had to. You can find bootlegs of some of the shows from these tours on YouTube (the last few shows in Los Angeles and the show in Melbourne, specifically) that show just how bad his voice was affected by nodules.
If that's the case why does this version have it end shortly  after live aid?

The band would have creative freedom to do what they want 
I have heard from multiple sources (including one who was / is working closely with the band) that yes, Brian May really did want to make the film about how Queen overcame the death of their lead singer and went on to bigger and better things. Whether or not SBC left because of that I don't know.
my understanding is the band wanted to downplay freddie's homosexuality and SBC wasnt willing to do that because he felt it was insult.
It's interesting hearing the story from both sides.   


SBC claimed that Brian May wanted a G-rated version and Sacha wanted warts and all. 
[deleted]
If they end it at Live Aid, it'd be cool to have The Show Must Go On as the credits music.  A small acknowledgment to his death, and the fact that the rest of Queen is still playing today.
I hear they have hired Satan to play the part of Jim Beach in the film
I'm just hoping there will be bumming and cocaine midgets, it's what Freddie would have wanted.
Didn't they show him holding another man's hand there in one shot? I imagine it'll at least be addressed during the movie. 
[deleted]
*please let it be tilda swinton*
Nikola Tesla I hope... he needs to return the favour
Okay so for their first 3 albums, Queen were signed by a production company called Trident, rather than a record company. This meant that Queen would record the music for Trident, who would then sell it to a record company.

Trident took damned near all of Queen's profits. The band would be sharing a station wagon to go to gigs, and the higher-ups would be showing up in new Rolls Royce's.

So what do you do if you're Freddie Mercury, and you're pissed? You write a god damned awesome song as a personal 'fuck you' to the owner, and his company. [Death On Two Legs](https://youtu.be/kqVpk0qxmfA) was the first song on Queen's Night At the Opera album (the one with Bohemian Rhapsody on it, that made ALL the money), their first album free of Trident. 

David Bowie is a separate story.
I'm gonna go out on a limb and label this Queen-bro as accurate.
Ooh you and me would be friends. I like your attention to detail. If that’s the way it’ll be it’ll bother me too. 
Weren't they playing We Will Rock You over the Queen fans at Wembley clapping hands to Radio Gaga though? 

I just put it down to the trailer mashing things up. The detail in Smile, Hot Space etc makes me question if they've got this wrong.

Will have to wait till it's released I suppose.

*Edit: also, pretty sure when he was diagnosed wasn't public until just before his death. Remember that shitty photo in The Sun. 
All of the band wrote some great songs, some of the best wrote by the always underrated bassist John Deacon
It's a guy named Ray Foster, portrayed by non other than Mike Myers.
Why the hell would it be Jeff Lynn? By the time he was big, Queen was already much bigger
The problem isn't remi but that Sacha left because brian may was sugarcoating the script means theyll be making it more of a "fun" movie instead of what could have been a more serious movie. 
Every new post about this movie ends up with the same comments and 90% of them are people repeating things like it's a first hand opinion.

Honestly, I think people are being unkind to the rest of the band members since they barely know about em
He's the obvious choice if you want anyone of the modern day.
*Verrih naiice!*

Shit, and then Part 5 anime is confirmed for autumn, too. this makes me very happy.
Breakdown breakdown!
Ya-yatazo, hatsudou shitazo!

Sheer hearto attackuh
I-I DID IT! IT ACTIVATED!
**BOOM**
I read the platters of coke were strapped to the top of midget waiters' heads. Little walking coke tables.
The band not wanting to include any of this in the biopic is adding even more insult to injury because Freddie Mercury has said himself that if they ever make a biopic about him he WANTS them to depict all of the sex and drugs and partying
As far as we know, he'd also go off stage in between songs and fuck a dude to 'refresh himself' and just go back on stage.
Also, at the end of their concerts, while singing We are the champions, Darth Vader would come up on stage and carry Freddy on his shoulders: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fd/4f/eb/fd4febd2f007a29331882bf6f057a596.jpg
Ah, so the interesting stuff.
What a crazy guy wanting a Freddie Mercury bio-pic to be about Freddie Mercury. :-P
Man that makes me really underwhelmed for the film.
Well fuck. Now the whole time I’m just going to want to see the Sacha Baron Cohen version. 
Wow, that sounds fucking terrible. 
He would have been perfect!!
My friend saw an early cut, and said Freddie doesn't die half way through anymore. He also said it gets pretty dark.

That being said, I'm still not looking forward to it.
What they didn't want to say was that no one will watch the second part of the movie where there are only May, Deacon and Taylor. I love Queen but this band was 90%Freddie and 10%those guys. I'm sorry but that's the truth. 
Woah, you can't call them that anymore, dude. They're *serving dishes*, not platters.
Freddie Mercury was Stefon before Bill Hader was Stefon.

I can dig it. 
I mean, I'm pretty sure they'll show him looking I'll and frail. It's the other stuff that will probably get glossed over.
Thats the movie Brian May wanted and everyone was like..wtf? no one wants to see that movie. 
I think that for someone who isn't Queen fan this band is Freddie and some other guys.
I wouldn’t say disaster. Like a lot of band artists, solo albums are more of a way to get a little more personal with the music, explore different interests. I’m sure most would love the solo album to be a hit but I don’t think Mercury (or whatever artist) expected to go quintuple platinum. 

But to the larger point, Mercury definitely was just known as a singer in a certain well known band. The creepier Freddie fanatics probably will say he’s some sort of cultural icon but to the average Joe he’s the We Will Rock You guy with the big mustache and funny teeth that reminded them of the Blue Oyster scenes from Police Academy. 
It sorta mirrors the current impasse, a Freddie movie isn't much without licensing Queen's material, but to get Queen material you have to appease Brian May to the point that it's no longer a Freddie movie
even more than five. When it first hit they suspected some people had been in the incubate stage for 7+ years... Scary shit.
He needs more blankets and less blankets!
Get out of here, Dewey. You don't want no part of this shit!
Preacher: “You think we don’t know what you’re taking about when you say, ‘take my hand’”

Dewey: “What are you taking about the songs about holding hands?”

Paw: “You watch your mouth boy”

Preacher: “You know who has hands? The devil! And he uses em for holdin!”
bye, You'll never gonna make it!"
:(
I mean, if you find an actual fat bottomed girl? Can confirm, you will be rocked.

Just not sure the author is behind (lulz) the concept as much as the song would imply. :D
So then OPs comment wouldn't make much sense either as it's not really a "British" accent. 
I remember reading that as well. He could have easily fixed his famous overbite but was really worried that it would ruin his iconic voice. I’m kinda glad he didn’t get the surgery cause that would have sucked if it did fuck with his voice. 
It was the right choice. Freddie was a perfect masterpiece exactly the way he was.
You can start to track it from the early-80s onward when the coke habit was really mucking up his voice. Too Low For Zero was one of the last records where he's really able to use his falsetto (i think on "One More Arrow" maybe?) made famous in Bennie and the Jets
I also didn't know this about Elton but it makes sense. He used to sing so, so high, but I just assumed it was age that resulted in his voice lowering considerably.

I knew Adele had treatment, and John Mayer also went for almost a year without singing/speaking when he developed nodes. It's gotta be terrifying.
It actually did ruin her voice (the botched surgery)
He's 71. That's why he's doing this big long farewell tour (going to see him in December!)
I've been around for Elton's whole career (young kid at the time, but still) and I still hafta remind myself that Your Song came out in 1970. He has been around for a long long time.
Movies change a lot from the draft stage to the final product. They could have changed their minds about it as it continued.
True or not, handling it that way sounds fairly disrespectful to Freddie. The guy who made them what they are dying and them turning it into a personal triumph rubs me the wrong way.
bisexuality*
Could be. Brian May has refuted that fact and said they won't whitewash anything, but we'll have to wait for the finished film to be sure. Maybe SBC wanted full penetration shots :D
Ever since I saw Sacha in Hugo I always thought he should have played Freddie.

He looks just like him and he has the chops to play him correctly.


I think we might have called SBC a great actor if he had made this film. Never will know in regards to that now though 
I really need to hear him say "I'll fucking do it, darling" in this movie.
Damn, if that is how they decide to end the movie I already know I'll be sniffling my way through the credits :(
I know The Show Must Go On came first, but what about These Are The Days Of Our Lives?

Imagine the credits ending with *I still love you*.
I look forward to my mother in-law portraying Jim Beach.
[deleted]
Wow I really want to see Tilda Swinton as David Bowie now. Who else could possibly portray him??
> David Bowie is a separate story.

Tell the story! Tell the Story!
Yeah I don't know enough about Queen to dispute it
Sounds like mike myers, looks like paul giammati.
Is he the one on YouTube who sounds *exactly* like Freddie?
If they don't make a joke with some asian guy losing his fucking mind over Queen I will be so disappointed.
Shit I had not heard this! I am pumped.
**BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN**
I need no confirmation or denial on this, I want to accept it as true without question. 
New York's hottest club is Bohemian Rhapsody 
god i hope to be a millionaire someday
Is that you Stefon? 
They prefer to be called itty-bitties
At first I didn't get that coke=cocain and I wondered why the hell would he hire midgets to run around with platters of coca-cola cans on their heads.
There’s this new club in lower lower upper New York called Mercury Poisoning. It’s got everything. Midget waiters with platters of coke strapped to their heads. 
Straight Out of Compton pulled off the drugs and sex while being a great movie. 
It's a Queen biopic, though. Yeah I get that Freddie pretty much was the band but still, nothing wrong with giving all of the band some attention. That being said, all of this is rumor and conjecture and I don't know if we'll ever find out definitely why SBC left.

EDIT: learn2spell
This is what I heard forever ago and this is why I have tempered expectations for this flick. 
as far as the singing and stage presence goes... yes.  but behind the scenes, every single band member wrote MORE than one #1 hit song at some point.  They are the only band to ever do that and the only band whose every member is in the songwriter's hall of fame.  


And here I thought that aristocrat lady passed out because I called Polaner All Fruit "jelly."
This was a particularly bad case of somebody being cut in half. 
I'm afraid you're right. 
And you never once paid for drugs.
Dewey* 
No, because he still grew up "in the colonies" so to speak. Which is why most people would assume it's just another "British" accent. But there's dozens of distinct accents just on the U.K. mainland.

So you could call it "British" as long as you and everyone else understand that's extremely broad. Like refering to all dogs as simply "Dogs" rather than by breed etc. And Freddie's accent was kind of like a "mut" of accents.
Just ask Julie Andrews how much a bad doctor can fuck up your voice
It's why streisand never got a nose job
The one funny story I know about Elton is in the early 80’s he was shooting “I’m Still Standing,” and he was super stressed about it- really worried, and he went into Simon LeBon’s(lead singer of Duran Duran) room and told him. Simon handed him a martini and said something like, “Don’t worry about it dear, drink this,” and Elton said he was blacked out for like the next two days. 

There’s two days of his life that he can’t remember. 
I guess in a sense it did, given that she was so exceptional before and she's an absolute shadow of that now. The tonal quality is also greatly changed. She can still hold a tune and still has a bit of a pleasant vibrato, but that's a long long fall from where she came. 
I was thinking the same thing. I'm not sure exactly how Queen went on to "bigger and better" things after Freddie died; perhaps someone could enlighten me?  


I'm a Gen-Xer (born in 1978) and my first exposure to Queen was when Mike Myers featured "Bohemian Rhapsody" in the film "Wayne's World." They kind of re-exploded after that, and I remember a lot of us kids sort of fell in love with Freddie and were devastated to learn that he'd passed away.  


Fittingly, my own child, who is 7, is a huge fan of Freddie now and is really excited for this movie to come out.
I suppose "homosexual relationships" would be a more respectful way of phrasing that, this trailer does little to give me hope that that hasn't been somewhat whitewashed.
Freddy didn’t love any gender specifically. Freddy simply loved!
And the usual Borat teabagging haha
Spoilers: They white wash the fuck out of it because the truth wouldn't make as much money.
Wembley. 
Penetration.
Quebec.
Penetration. 
Live Aid.
Full penetration. 
And this goes on and on for a about 2 hours or so until the movie just.... ends. 
Hugo is such a good movie and Sacha Baron Cohen is soooo good in it.

Gillian Anderson does a phenomenal riff on Bowie, especially in the Aladdin Sane era, in 'American Gods'. Not saying she could play him in any realistic way, but she did capture his 'vibe'.

Michael Sheen is a bit broad-faced for Bowie, but he does Bowie's mannerisms to a 'T', as seen when he played Castor in Tron: Legacy.

Okay so it's the turn of a new decade, and Queen meet with David Bowie to come up with a song.

>*Marmite_Badger's vaguely related fun fact: Before fame, Freddie and Roger used to run a stall in Kensington Market, and once sold David Bowie a pair of boots!*

So whilst brainstorming ideas, John Deacon used to have this simple bass riff he used to play. You know the one. Bowie and the guys like this, and decide they'll use it to write a song.

...And then they all went out for pizza, and John forgot it.

He remembered it a little while later, and so Under Pressure began to develop!

So the idea was that Freddie and David would be locked in separate recording booths, and that they'd independently come up with their own lyrics. This was going great, until they both started to peak in on each other's sessions, which is why the lyrics feel independent, but still linked!

I just wish I could KING CRIMSON myself into the fall season
It seems that Michael Jackson was a frequent on Freddie’s parties. And here’s a photo of [Michael with some midgets](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQtXFefB_2dE19VPLV3fk50AxI5vSD9-xhb-xEX5AV7PwHaSufNDvNigBIp) in one of those parties.
Princess Diana was known to party with him, I think they got coked up and dressed her in cliche gay cop outfit and went dancing at a gay club one night. 
Sadly, Roger Taylor denies that happened. Although he did acknowledge it was a good idea. Of the other members of Queen, I get the impression he would be the one to know about it.

I believe nowadays $M is (relatively) easy. That kind of lifestyle is closer to the $B. 
Exactly. They have no reason to not want to include that stuff other than to pander towards families and promote their own image
Didn't Straight Outta Compton a face a lot criticism for completely omitting Dr Dre's abuse of women though? It's a great film but it hardly seems like a shining example of a biopic choosing not to shy away from the darker/less commercial elements of a true story.
While mostly glossing over stuff like how Dr Dre beat women not much unlike Chris Brown does.
Sounds like they pivoted from what the original plan was with SBC. Which is why he left. I could be wrong though.

Either way, Freddie Mercury and all the music he made with the band/crazy rock star lifestyle he had are all the average viewer really cares about. I would assume. That's the only reason I am interested. The rest of the band seems dull to me, an uninformed viewer.
>The only thing more extraordinary than their music is **his** story


First line in the trailer. It's supposed to be his story, not their story. 

I’m certain I’ve seen an interview with SBC on why he left the project. Essentially it boiled down to Brian/Queen feeling that Freddie dying would be a halfway point of the movie, and SBC thought it was crazy to have the main character die and then have another half of a movie. I’ll try to find the link but I’m currently pooping. 

EDIT: I finished pooping. It was on Howard Stern. Per SBC, the band felt that “In the second half of the movie we see how the band carries on from strength to strength.”

> It's a Queen biopic, though.

I'm in this camp.  Queen is the only band where every member has individually written a number one song (x3 each too).  Thus it is more than just Freddie and it's a better movie if they go with that, rather than another cult-of-personality  biopic.  I'd imagine Sasha Baron Cohen would prefer it to be all about Freddie because it'd be more of a star vehicle for him then.  ;)
Speak English doc! We ain't all scientists!
This movie is fucking gold, surprised Reddit doesn't love it more.
Not once.
So it's exactly what I originally said
Doesn't surprise me at all. 

Here's the anecdote from the [Wiki for "I'm Still Standing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Still_Standing)

During the shoot for the video, John came across Duran Duran. He complained he was exhausted at having been up since 4 o'clock in the morning. Simon Le Bon decided John should have a martini. "So I did," John later recalled, "I had six."[6]

In his book Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran, Andy Taylor talks of the experience:

    There were lots of celebrities around in Cannes and one day we discovered that Elton John was in town, filming the video for his song I'm Still Standing. This was before Elton became teetotal, so he was still a steaming party animal; we went up to see him at his hotel and spent the afternoon getting blasted on Martinis. We decided it would be a laugh to get him drunk and we were slinging the drinks down him 'Ooh, you are lovely boys,' he screeched, loving every minute of it. We got him so drunk that eventually he went upstairs and threw a wobbler in his suite. It caused all sorts of chaos – but it was a great party.[7]

The next morning, John awoke with a hangover and wandered into his personal assistant's room—which was "leveled"—and asked him "What happened?" His assistant laughed: "You happened!"[6] 
I read your previous comment and typed this answer: Right right :) yes I suppose in interviews she said there are lower notes she can still get to. Hard not to say it ruined her voice though when her huge range and skill drops to “pleasant enough”. I’m extremely jealous you got to see her, I’m basically her biggest fan ever, hence me jumping on to comment about someone not related to the original thread. I mourn for her lost voice on the regular. 

But now I see we agree ;)
They didn't really become bigger and better, but they did move on from it and continued to do pretty well. Yes, Freddie was pretty much the heart and soul of the band, but the rest of the band is still around to this day. I have no idea why that's a bad thing.
Which is still just bisexuality 
I just went through a rollercoaster of confusion.

"I don't remember Scully being in American gods."

"Shit, is the second season out and I missed it?"

"Oh, it's another actress with the same name."

"Nevermind."
Okay well this pic is the best hard evidence I've seen so far.
MJ was doing coke off a midget's ankle?

Turns out, he was a rock star, after all.
And the girl on the left appears to have some coke spilled on her foot lol
Yeah if I recall he was down with it all until he saw Freddie do some coke. Apparently, that was the *line*.

I'll see myself out.
This is indeed a true story. He dressed her in drag and took her to a gay club because it was the only way that she could go out dancing and not instantly be recognized.
I remember him talking about this too, he said if the coke dwarfs existed, he "never saw any" and he sounded disappointed with this.
yesyesyesyesyesyes
a few kilos of cocaine is definetely doable for millions its the midgets that shut up afterwards i think needs more than one million
> They have no reason to not want to include that stuff other than to pander towards families and promote their own image

Brian has always had a bit of a selective memory regarding some of the debauchery.  
I'm his greatest fan ever and even I recognize this about him. The family friendly vibe can 100% be attributed to his influence IMO.
It glossed over a LOT of stuff. Dre and Cube were producers on it. 
Hmm. I did not know that. 
>The rest of the band seems dull to me, an uninformed viewer.

I just watched a Queen documentary recently. It's called Days of our Lives and [it's on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAMyWdQkey0) and it's pretty good if you're interested.

The things that most surprised me were that besides Freddie, the drummer Roger is hilarious in interviews in stock footage, and that a lot of the stories of how they wrote their iconic songs are really interesting stories to put in a biopic even if they don't involve Freddie.

Like, the bass player John Deacon came up with Another One Bites The Dust and the rest of the band absolutely hated it. He recorded every instrument himself apart from the drum track and the vocals, and they humored him and put it on the album. Then at a live show they played it once. Michael Jackson was in the audience (he was friends with Freddie) and he insisted they release it as a single because he loved that bass line so much. It ended up becoming their biggest ever hit in America because it got picked up by African American radio stations that mostly played funk. That's a great story to put in a Queen biopic.
We need more AND less blankets!
I wasn't meaning to disagree with you so much as elaborate to begin with.but I can see where the confusion comes from.
Threw a wobbler?
We do, and trust me, I mourned the whole surgery fiasco too. 
It's not a bad thing, not at all. I'm a fan of the rest of the band as well and I'm glad they continued doing their thing. But I question whether they'd be in the position to do so without Freddie catapulting them to the top in the first place.
Not sure how you missed her, she has a huge role. Sadly, she will not be returning for the second season and neither will Kristin Chenoweth. Both were friends of Bryan Fuller and chose to leave the show when he was fired. The first season was so great and I'm really skeptical that the second season can even come close without Fuller's phenomenal visual style.
It's not another actress, Scully is one of the gods in the first season, man.
Wait wait wait. 


Take my upvote. 

Ok, **NOW** get the fuck out. 
Imagine the headlines - PRINCESS AND QUEEN ON GAY CLUB COKE BENDER
And no pictures of this exist?!
There's no Google evidence here. Or is there?
Sounds like a blast. Especially to go out and not be “princess” for a night. 
>  and he sounded disappointed with this.

Somehow this bit makes him so much more believable than if he had just denied that it happened
[deleted]
I love these stories of brilliant accidents. 
I never knew that and it would explain why the production sounds so rough on it. 
Had a tantrum, at least in the use of the word that I'm familiar with. Probably included throwing stuff around and breaking things.
