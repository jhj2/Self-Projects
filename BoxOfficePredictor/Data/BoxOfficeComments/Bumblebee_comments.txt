Original Soundwave and Shockwave designs... Nice 
It doesn’t feel right that this is a prequel to Bay’s Transformers, since the tone is so drastically different and it actually looks decent. Paramount should seriously just retcon the last five movies and make this the start of a new franchise. Transformers 4 and 5 made me lose any shred of hope I had for Bay’s franchise so nothing will be missed there.
Those Cybertron scenes look like they're ripped right out of those Activision Transformers games from a few years back. And holy shit, those designs are perfect.

SOUNDWAVE LOOKS LIKE SOUNDWAVE

SHOCKWAVE LOOKS LIKE SHOCKWAVE

G1 OPTIMUS

*Oh, it's beautiful.*
Its crazy to think if you had to rank all the live action Transformer movies, the Bumblebee trailer would be #1. 
What's this? A Transformers movie that seems to not have a bizarre, hateful tone? Where's all the yelling and masturbation jokes? Who greenlit this shit? It looks like an actual movie or something...

But seriously, this trailer gives off a lot of good "Iron Giant" vibes and I'm cautiously optimistic.
I kinda hope this movie is a turning point for the franchise. 
I feel like the Cybertron scenes alone are going to be worth the ticket price for me. It's what I've wanted from the start of the live action movies. 
Love the return of the original transformation sound!
Travis Knight might have just breathed life back into this franchise.
Makes me wanna play the War for Cybetron/Fall of Cybertron games. I’m honestly excited to finally see a version where Cybertron isn’t just a barren wasteland filled with hexagons 
Shockwave!

&#x200B;

Such a shame that they didn't go with those designs all along.

This achieves more that what Micheal Bay did.

\- Bumblebee looks correct

\- Prime looks correct

\- Shockwave looks correct

\- Soundwave looks correct

\- Ravage looks correct

\- Original G1 transformation sound effect

\- Cybertron looks correct

\- Cybertronian pyramid fighters!

\- Triple Changers

\- Decepticon Jets look correct

Not-Controversial opinion: This movie looks surprisingly cute and interesting and I might actually check out a Transformers movie for the first time since the original.

Controversial opinion: I legit think Hailee Steinfeld looks better with bangs.
One thing I love that no one's really talking about right now - the trailer's opening.

Yes, the designs are amazing, but it being Charlie's birthday and the way the trailer opened with the old man was so heartwarming to me - a feeling I felt the last five Transformers movies failed to portray.
I lost it a 1:37 when you see Sound Wave’s chest open up and a cassette of Ravage jumps out. This is what the previous films should have been. 
They.. they finally got the designs right. Took them long enough.
When I saw the leaked trailer, I thought the Cybertron scenes were ripped out from the High Moon Studios games because *no way* they would actually look that good in the movie

But the crazy bastards actually did it
I've never been a huge Transformers fan. Growing up I enjoyed it but it was never my thing, I'm glad this seems to be a real turning point. I'm happy for you dudes who are super fans. 

The first was a great start and then it quickly took a wrong turn somewhere, I hope this ends up actually being great and I hope they continue on this path. 

I'm so excited for this movie. 
Please be good. Please be good. Please be good.
Michael Bay isn't directing it. I'll actually go see this. 
So is this in any way connected to the Bay movies or not? (apart from Optimus' voice)

The "every hero has a beginning" makes it sound like it's a prequel?

Other thoughts:  

* This looks very "Iron Giant", in a good way
* Very much a "giving away the whole movie" kind of trailer  

LMAO, you can see the difference between Shia and Hailey’s characters

Shia on TF1 while Bee’s being captured was like: I’m gonna stop these army guys by myself.


while Hailey’s character be like: Fight back, Bee.
Actually looks better than the last 4 Transformers movies and damn, the OG designs look pretty good
Wow... so this is what Transformers look like without Bay directing?

Love the OG/G1 style for most of the bots. I hope we get some more G1 characters like Ironhide, Mirage, Trailbreaker, etc.

I'm actually kind of looking forward to this after seeing this trailer.
Honest to god G1 designs. Fuck yeah.
Oh shit, I can actually visibly discern who each Transformer is by appearance. With the Bay movies I could only ever tell who Optimus and Bumblebee were. That alone is a massive, massive improvement. 
Very interested in heel Cena. Plus I’m excited to see if Travis Knight can make a Brad Bird-esque jump to live action.
It’s been so long since a Transformers movie trailer gave me goosebumps.

I love all of Travis Knight’s movies and can tell he puts so much in his work. The writers are two women, one of whom wrote and directed the movie Edge of Seventeen which I thought was one of the best coming-of-age movies in the past decade. So I can already tell this is at least better than all the other Transformers films.


The Transformers look great with a G1 and 2018 makeover, Cybertron even looks like it's G1 cartoon version.   I'm really looking forward to this movie.  

&#x200B;

You see Hollywood?  You never needed the Bayformers after all.  You just needed some filmmakers with actual respect and care for the franchise.  
It looks so good!! Let’s just hope they can get “The Touch” into one of these films at some point. 
Tonally, this movie looks very different to Bayformers. More grounded. I can’t put my finger on it, but I think this has so much potential and could kick off a whole new series of Transformer films.
my god i still can't believe a live action G1 transformers movie is happening
Wow. It only took 11 years but it feels like they finally hit the right tone for these movies. The scenes with the robots look well developed: it's not just robots fighting for the sake of fighting, and it doesn't look like someone filmed bunch of hot wheels in a blender for action scenes.
G1 boner rising!
G1 related designs and the use of the famous transformation sound effect? That's a good thing.
SOUNDWAVE - Take my money. 
SHOCKWAVE

SOUNDWAVE
For Christmas, I finally get to see the G1 transformers. The little boy I used to be is bouncing off walls right now.
If Megatron shows up in the movie I hope they don't spoil it in the trailer.
I like how she starts the movie by stating clearly that she’s 18 


Lol Hollywood 
Fuck it. They should just retcon the entire previous series of movies and pretend they never happened. 
I really don't know what to say if you can't differentiate this from Bay. This looks so competently made with sequences that are easy to follow and characters that look like characters. 
The Cybertron scenes look impressive, like they came straight out of the games. Looks good overall, hope it’s good.
The Autobots and Decepticon look so unique and you can tell between all the design than the Bay version. We going to get a really good live-action transformer movie for the first time. 
well i'm hyped. I'm a G1 fan and the soundwave sold me. 
I really loved those last 2 scenes - the action one with Hailee running with the huge fight in the background is a cool shot and that [Bumblebee in the cat flap](https://i.gyazo.com/3b8d7d99b62efcf3807b588f2e6e09aa.jpg) shot had me giggling quite a lot.
This is looking more and more promising.   
 I really think Travis Knight has figured out the right tone for this kind of movie, it feels like a cross between The Iron Giant and the original Transformers.

That looks exactly what I wanted the Transformers movies to be from the beginning. I hope this is a soft reboot for the entire series.
The real question is: Can Cena lift up Bumblebee for the AA?
G1 !! Woohoo!
This Trailer was better than the last 4 films
So many old schools- this is what it should have always been like. 
[deleted]
Looks like fun.
This feels like such a different transformers movie, I'm actually a bit hyped for it
A Transformers movie not directed by Michael Bay looks good? GASP 

But real talk, this looks like such a good time at the movies. Transformers is one of those properties that has such AMAZING potential in any medium (movies, games) if in the right hands. This movie looks like it’s in the right hands. 
I am so excited for this movie just from the Cybertron scenes alone. The designs! THE GLORIOUS DESIGNS!!

 I'm praying that those scenes in the trailers aren't the only parts, please show more!! It's what the fans wanted all along
And they were standing on Unicron the whole time. This one looks good, and fun.
This actually looks fun
Live action G1 styled tramsformers.

Yeah im in. 
What is this? A good sequel to Fall of Cybertron?
The only good part of bay movies was the intro attack on the army base in the first movie. However this trailers for this actually make it look good.


From what I can remember the first of those films made it like the transformers/decepticons had recently appeared on earth, with some of them showing up during the movie.  Is that correct?  So is this a reboot or is the story that the military did nothing during the 20+ years between the fight in this film and the old films?
Haven't been interested in Tranformers since high-school but I'm definitely curious about this
No I’m most definitely not just watching this movie just for Hailee
That Shockwave. Holy crap. Even with the cables/hoses...
Holy shit! Soundwave looks like Soundwave. Not some weird ass satellite or Mercedes. Shockwave looks great and that Starscream!!!

Bumblebee: The G-1 movie.

Update: thanks to a fellow redditor, I realized that was not Starscream but Blitzwing.
Bumblebee, you must protect Earth from Michael Bay
Welp, it only took 11 years, but they finally learned to put the Transformers I remember watching as a kid, on the big screen.
These G1 designs are so beautiful I’m crying that they’re finally on screen 😭
do we know if the cybertron fights is like 7 seconds of the movie?
Who Else Saw Starscream and Acid Storm?
SOLD!  Also Fuck you Michael Bay.
Just a question, why can't there be a Transformer movie without humans? 
Without Michael Bay directing, this might actually be an okay movie.
That last shot of her running in front of Bee and the other Cybertronian or whatever looks amazing.  Im sold.
Only going to see this movie because of Hailee Steinfeld 
I hate the Bay films and I'm all aboard for this one.  Fuck Michael Bay's garbage designs and his terrible action directing.  He's one of the worst filmmakers to ever been given a budget.  These transformers look great.
Bumblebee as a Volkswagen = small brain

G1 Starscream = Big brain

G1 Optimus = Bigger brain

I wanna fuck G1 Soundwave = Biggest brain
Holy shit. Those Cybertron scenes. Those classic Transformers designs. Seeing that made me feel like a kid again. Woooowww
This is a reboot right? I hope so
Honestly besides the look of the transformers this looks just like your average transformers movie.
I'm hoping this movie will be good.
This shit brought a tear to my eye. The storm cloud that’s been over this franchise has finally been lifted.
Really loving the vibe of this trailer + the action looks pretty solid. 
I'm so happy. 
This looks like the Transformers I grew up with, might be the first Transformers movie I watched since the second one
Sold.  Hell, I’ll even buy the damn action figures.  
Man I'd really like to watch a Transformers film were it's not just bloated explosion and human conflict. I'll wait until the reviews come out for this film and if it's somewhere decent then maybe I'll catch it in theaters.
Going back to the original designs is probably the best thing that they could have done, I can't wait to see more of what the G1 style design is going to look like. 
Yep. I am watching this movie. I am all over this reboot. It is a reboot right?
You had me at G1 designs
damn, this looks like it could be surprisingly good.  really excited for this.
This looks good. Cant believe I'm excited for a Transformers movie again. 
It seems like this should have been the original Transformer movie, especially since its set in the past.
So can we like, just go from here if it's as good as it looks and just use this as a reboot?
When I saw Shockwave I did an M.Bison and yelled "YES! YES!" while fistpumping.

Fucking pumped for this movie now, first trailer had me interested but now 100% going to see it. I didn't have to be told which characters were which, and it looks as though we're going for a damn good soft reboot.

NE: ALSO, if Megatron shows up in his G1 form I'm probably gonna pass out from hyperventilating.
G1 fucking starscream, soundwave AND ravage?!?!?

oh i might be a little hype
The Updated G1 designs have literally sold me on this movie. 
I said I was out after the last knight but if I want to see this if there's Cybertron scenes
Wow... a movie based on my kids favorite toys that I think I can actually take them to.  

Maybe.

I hope.
\**clang*\*

I ate da whole plate.
NAH THE MOVIE LOOKS GOOD! F OFF HATERS
Tone looks so different which I like. I also love John Cena so I’m in
Might be the first Transformers movie that I would want to see. Without Michael Bay you can actually understand what's happening on the screen during action scenes. Also the retro style is what we've always wanted instead of the crappy modern Transformers. 
This was actually a really good film and proof that you can have a female lead without having to push any sort of narrative. It worked well as a prequel with enough references to know it's cannon with Michael Bay's trilogy but not enough to make it cheesey.

8.5/10
Fuck. FUCK. I'm getting excited for a Transformers movie, this can't be happening.
Am I the only one who isn’t into this? After all of the positivity in the comments I expected more from this trailer but it’s literally another cookie cutter Transformers movie that we’ve had too many of over the past decade. 
Come December, my wallet will cry harder than it ever has.

This looks *perfect*.
The fact that it doesn’t have Michael Bay and has John Cena in it is huge positives. 

I thought the trailer looked great. Considering it’s release date. This movie looks better than AquaMan 
I take it Michael Bay is not directing this as I could follow most of the actions scenes and transformations in that trailer.
Hell, I didn't even watch the original cartoons (more of a beasties/beast wars fan myself), but seeing those original designs brought to life is pretty awesome.
This looks rather basic. Not that different than the Bay offerings.
I literally shed a tear at the multi-transformations. Bring this movie on!
[removed]
I'm REALLY hoping this movie can turn this franchise around. I love Transformers but Michael Bay has completely fucking ruined it imo. 

This looks like it actually has some heart to it and I love they are keeping with the original designs and feel that the cartoon seemed to deliver. Really looking forward to seeing how it turns out.
soundwave looked fantastic 
I think I saw Thundercracker and Skywarp too!
Optimus is also shown with his original design, and ya know also Bumblebee. It appears they've gone the route of hitting nostalgia.
for real! It's been how many films and they're finally making more of the bots look like they're supposed to instead of the robo hell beast they had been? This movie is actually starting to look promising.
Please have Grimlock, please have Grimlock.
I may or may not have nutted multiple times upon seeing them in OG style.
Wonder if Rumble, Lazerbeak and the rest of the tapes get 'ejected' outta Soundwave too? That would be sweet 
Optimus looked great too
For those of us who grew up during the time these toys first came out and who typically carried one of the "cassettes" to school with him, this movie finally looks like it gets Transformers correct.  I can honestly die happy now.  Well, i'd love a reference or if Cyclonus was in the film but other than that...perfect.
Soundwave has always been my favorite and I was so upset by the Michael Bay version.  This one is pretty sexy but the movie is probably still gonna suck
I think this is a reboot. 
The movies had effectively no continuity, because the plots of each sequel invalidated something in the previous ones drastically. They are so loosely tied together I'm not sure you could even call it retconning
As much as half the sequels had any continuity with the preceding movies.
Don't hate on the 1st one...2-4 can go
It really looks like it has more *heart*, which is something the Bay movies have been missing for a while.
Credit to High Moon Studios, who developed those games. They need a sequel to Fall of Cybertron! Maybe this film can help to get it off the ground...
God damn it. I thought I was done and they pulled me back in. Fucking Shockwave and Ravage looking like their OG selves!! I want to see what this looks like not in Michael Bay's hands real bad!!
Unfortunately thats probably all we'll see of it.
Yep. They actually look like transformers.  
Dude those designs are the best
Makes me wonder why they didn't do this in the first damn place. It's what everyone wanted.
Maybe Puscifer will score the opening scene during the Fall of Cybertron.
And it's not even close
I for one miss the jokes about the transformer’s giant metal balls, as I felt they lent the film a certain gravitas
> A Transformers movie that seems to not have a bizarre, hateful tone?

After watching the 2 Wahlberg films, I just didnt understand the character. He was essentially saying 'fuck you' as every line of dialog. 
John Cena, it seems, will be the Mansley of this movie
Wait. Does the previous movies have a lot of masturbation jokes?
I remember watching the first transformers with my family and at some point Shia Leboufs parents ask him if he was masturbating. That’s when my younger sister asked my family what masturbating was. It was such an awkward moment that I still remember it years later. 
be careful.   I was baited into watching each of the movies because if you watch the trailers they have a very serious tone with none of the things you mention.    I think i finally gave up after the 4th one.   Go back and watch the trailers foe each of them and then compare them to what you got.

Gen1 hype.
I feel that casting Hailee Steinfeld really works in that regard as well. The kind of protagonists that the director chooses to embrace goes a long way in setting the tone for the film.

Here's hoping it will turn out well.
Every time a Transformers trailer comes out, r/movies has a positive reaction. It's almost like a cycle. The disappointment is coming. 
A transformers movie that doesn't glorify the military and actually makes them the bad guys working with the decepticons? how did this get made?
I feel like Transformers have always had fantastic trailers that just make me that much more disappointed in the final product. 
[deleted]
Here's to hoping, I do like Bumblebee
I kinda hope this movie reboots the franchise.
I kinda hope this movie ends up being good and they use it to reboot the franchise. 
I really want this to be a full reboot of the series. And each movie focuses on a different Autobot. Do 3 or 4 of them. And then do a full-on "War For Cybertron" movie.

Mimic the Marvel Studios formula in a way but introduce a new Decepticon villain in each movie for the Autobot to combat. And then bring both groups together.

Honestly? This looks fucking great. And I *REALLY* hope they don't try to shoehorn a continuity bridge between this movie and the Bay Transformers series. It'll ruin it for me.
Seeing Optimus...ugh they all look fantastic 
They had me at Soundwave. Especially with Ravage popping out of his chest like that.
The original transformation sound was in the first movie aswell. For some dumb reason, they removed it in all the sequels.
I wonder if Michael Bay is the jealous type who will go "Hey this is getting *too* popular and overshadowing my work. Time for the Bayster to come back!"
Christina Hodson should be getting the credit for this. She wrote the script long before they were even looking for directors. https://deadline.com/2016/11/transformers-bumblebee-christina-hodson-script-paramount-pictures-spinoff-script-1201852869/
Last level of ~~War for~~ Fall of Cybertron with constantly changing characters during final battle made grin my face off and feel like a kid again, it was everything I ever imagined as a child.

And Megatron's speech to Trypticon... chills down my spine!
As a PC gamer I can do this! Going to do it co op style.
You know i always kinda wanted to try that and Transformers Devastation but it looks like they got pulled from Steam :(
Also this one apparently has a script with a story. Not just a series of action shots strung together by the loose association with plot or motivation, but something that appears to resemble an actual story. As if a writer actually gave a fuck. That's certainly a first for a transformer movie. 
I mean... if they had, they would’ve just been great G1 designs in a shitty Michael Bay movie.
Wait, what is this ? Colorful Decepticons ? No way
I don't understand they seem to be bad so why aren't they bland and colourless? 
Like, how frikin hard was it to go this way to begin with?
That's the Shockwave I've been waiting for since I was a kid
I could never had dreamed I'd see Acid Storm in a live-action movie, but here we are...
Is that Thrust/Dirge in the background too?
Travis Knight superior, Michael Bay inferior.
I'm a sucker for girls with bangs
Didn't recognize her until I read your comment, wow

Yeah she cute with bangs
That opening seems to be pretty much exactly the opening of the first Transformers movie, the hero is getting a new car that happens to be Bumblebee. But the first Transformers movie was also the best so I would say it's not such a bad sign.
The writers are two women, one of whom wrote and directed Edge of Seventeen, also with Hailee Steinfeld, which is arguably, one of the best coming-of-age movies in the past decade. I understand they usually include the more cliche lines in trailers but I have high hopes that characters will be well developed in this, especially compared to the Bay movies.
Honestly the beginning feels very cliché to me. It seems like such an obvious coming of age trope filled arc, in just hoping they get through it quickly in order to get to the transformers stuff. We spent 4 the entirety of the original trilogy covering coming of age, we don’t need to restart it again.
Same 
Greetings from TFW2005.
I believe it is. Mainly due to it looking like Cenas character is part of Section Eight and showing their base as the Hoover Dan again
That's Peter Cullen's voice, the original voice of Optimus from the 80s. He did voice Optimus in the Bay movies, but that's less a connection and more an acknowledgment that recasting that voice is folly.
The first trailer had Bernie Mac’s speech from the first Transformers. 
I think it's a new thing: a prequel set up to be a potential fork in the film continuity/timeline. Kinda like the plot of Star Trek 2009, but they're not going to acknowledge the old continuity if things do end up changing. This movie still functions as a prequel to the Bayverse, but if it's successful enough to be a franchise-starter, it can also simultaneously have another timeline fork off of it where everything's different. It's a prequel, a soft reboot, and it's ready to be a hard reboot if it can. I call it a preboot.
Well yeah she knows she can't take on John Cena.
He gonna do a baby face turn. Isn't that what they call it in wrestling?

Whatever it's called, he seems too likeable to stay a mean evil dude all the way through. He'll probably tag team with Bumblebee
Climax of the film, Optimus beams down to help while Bee plays YOU GOT THE TOUCH on tape
Director knows that all those robots actually have distinct personalities unlike Bay...
sense of childlike innocence in the way it's directed really shows. Bay was more childlike love of explosions and sexing up main women in the movie. 
I was super excited when I saw the first trailer with the G1 Bumble Bee and Starscream. But hoooooly shit G1 everybody! Especially Optimus Prime.
If G1 design Megatron shows up I would be so happy. 
If they were smart, they would have Starscream as the lead bad guy, have him of course fail, and then show Megatron in a post credits scene. 
Can confirm he is not in this particular trailer.  Many other G1's though.  
I mean he has to, right? The Hoover Dam was shown so he has to end up there somehow.
He has to carry Bumblebee and climb to the middle rope if he wants the pin. Regular AA don’t pin shit anymore.
Where do you see Shockwave?
Making a *Transformers* movie with no humans at all would be very expensive to do to the same photorealistic standards the previous movies have established. 

Besides, human intervention helping the Autobots turn the tide against the Decepticons is an established part of the franchise and has been there since the beginning.
You could, but it'd be a niche concept and couldn't be done with a big budget. It's been done many times on TV.
Budget concerns. A entire Transformers movie set in Cybertron would most likely cost a fuck ton of money. 

It probably would become the most expensive movie of all time. 
Because that's not what Transformers is nor has it ever been like that.
I posted this above:

When you have strange sci-fi worlds, aliens, monsters, or vehicles that turn into robots, you need a human who can take the viewer through the story with them. Generally speaking. I’m sure there are some exceptions, but usually you want a protagonist who the viewer can project themselves onto.

It helps the viewer from feeling lost or overwhelmed.
Same. 

I’m not a huge Transformers fan. 
Because of her acting? or because butts?
The looks are a big element though. That inherently means the action scenes will be easier to follow which is always good to have in, y'know, an action movie. 

Plus, less characters since it's a standalone movie, which means that it's less likely to be overcrowded with 15 characters that barely get a name beyond a lazy ethnic stereotype. And, personally, (and seemingly objectively since a lot of other people are saying the same), it seems to have a lot more heart.
Yeah, pretty much does, but I dig the films, so fuuuuck it. 
Prequel
I can only speak for myself, but there were some minor/major details that seemed to set this apart from the Michael Bay era Transformers:

* The designs of the Transformers themselves are much more distinct and reminiscent of the 80s OG models
* The lack of 300mph potty humor targeting 12 year olds
* Action scenes that hold wide/long (less cuts, more in frame = more clear)
* More scenes in Cybertron
* A storytelling style from the director of Kubo and the Two Strings and writer of Edge of Seventeen

It just *feels* different than the Bay movies, or at least my nostalgia is being triggered harder. 

Feel free to revisit this comment after release and say "told you so" if the reviews are poor, but I'm optimistic about this one.
I think you mean: SOUNDWAVE SUPERIOR
Hopefully he has some lines to say and they use his original voice...from my sketchy memory, he was one of the few transformers with a robotic sounding voice
Starscream even looked pretty cool.
> It appears they've gone the route of hitting nostalgia.

Is it nostalgia or just a more accurate representation of the characters? 
It's working. 
It only took them 5 movies to learn what the new Ninja Turtles learned in one. 
Except Bumblebee's face is still a mess & he still can't talk...

I don't know why but it really bothers me that his face is just sitting exposed underneath the car.  He must get a lot of mud in his face when it rains.
While it's not original to his G1 style, I fucking love when Bumblebee drops his [battle mask](https://pursuenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screenshot-from-Bumblebee-Official-Teaser-Trailer-Paramount-Pictures.jpg). It looks so much cooler than the one in the Michael Bay movies. 
Never saw the original cartoons, but I do recognize the designs from there. I thought the very mechanical feel of the movies so far only made more sense in live action, and I liked seeing them. But huh, this trailer did show that they can make it look like the cartoons as well.
"Me Grimlock should be in movie"
I did nut multiple times. Especially when I saw Starscream! 
HE FINALLY LOOKS GOOD! Not a fucking Dorito!
I want an OG Prime toy. 
It’s a soft reboot. The last one set up that they could just make one off movies about transformers anytime anywhere this seems to be the one to test the waters if it’s a viable practice.
Soft reboot
The director of Kubo and the Two Strings is directing this film (Bumblebee), and apparently the advanced test screenings did very well, supposedly moving audiences to tears.

It may end up being a great movie, but if not, it'll at least be a decent family film. I'll be there opening weekend either way.
The first Michael Bay Transformers movie had enough heart for me to give a damn, but the ones after that lost me almost in sequence; like the stakes versus the emotional investment IN the movies didn’t match. 
I hope you’re right about this one.
I also noticed that what they showed of the fight scenes looked more like an Avengers movie than a just a bunch of quick cuts. I guess thats what happens when you change directors. 
This is the first Transformers movie I'll be seeing since the third one. 

And since I fell asleep during every one of the first three, this might actually be the first Transformers movie I see in its entirety.
Bay might not have had much heart in those movies but he sure had big robo testicles covered.
Those games (admittedly I've only played the sequel), were way better than they really had any right to be.
> High Moon Studios

High Moon is no more, they were dissolved in 2014:<

The rights to making a game are also a bit iffy, the old games have been pulled from Steam and other storefronts. It's almost like the games were making the movies look bad or something.
NO joke.  I had no desire to see this movie then bam, G1 forms and cybertron proper?!?
*Soundwave ;)
Because Bay thinks he knows better, when in reality he just has no imagination or creativity and simply steals shit from our childhood and ruins it.
Yes, I shed a single tear when the giant balls clanged together. 
If I don't see a Transformer giving someone a golden shower I'm gonna be seriously disappointed. 
And Megan Fox, Victoria's Secret Model #12, and Katera lent the series a certain gravitatas.
That's just marky mark being marky mark
Where was Cena? I didn’t see him.
"The missile is targeted to the Transformer's current position! *WHERE'S THE TRANSFORMER, MANSLEY!?*"
They also have a 5 minute “joke” about why it was ok for some guy to date an underage girl.



[They literally showed us the laws printed on a piece of paper](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/b/b5/Transformers-4-romeo-and-juliet-law.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20161217191539)
How could you forget Shia LeBouef's mom?
Not quite the same, but I believe Transformers 2 literally has multiple scenes of dogs fucking.
You saw John cena?!
Rumor is that the movie will surprise feature The Rock to set up for the sequel
Never thought I’d see the classic Optimus design in a live action movie but it looks amazing. Whole movie definitely has a much different feel from the Bay outings.
Soundwave and Shockwave have their classic designs!
It was sprinkled throughout the sequels as well, it just wasn’t as prevalent.
It’s always been around, just usually in small segments
Basically what happened to Alien 5.
As good as Days of Futures Past is, I really wish Matt Vaughn had directed it. 
Technically he's bankrolling this; he would have *already* editorialized this if he could.

If you actually look closely at his filmography he's a neat guy with neat handiwork and habits. I feel he gets stereotyped and blamed unfairly. Don't see Reddit ranting about how he invests his own money when the studio limits his budget to achieve his vision.
Honestly, I don't think he gives a shit in any emotional way, at all. 
This means the Transformers movies are loud, purile, incomprehensible dreck...but it also means Bay can move on because he knows he can make money anywhere he goes. He's not even directing Bad Boys 3.
He gives off the vibe that he is.
High Moon’s portrayals of the characters in those games were pretty much my ideal adaptations of them. Everyone looked, sounded, and acted perfectly. Really wish we could have had a sequel of sorts. 
That last level was in Fall of Cybertron, where you take control of like five characters from both sides while escaping Cybertron aboard the Ark/Nemesis.
Man, I still remember the music of that part of the game and with all the different actions sequences happening at the same time.
The multiplayer for those games was so damn good, damn shame it's dead.
It also doesn't seem to be thinly veiled US military propaganda.
Isn't it a bit early to be making a call like that?
Yeah, I'll actually be able to tell who is fighting who now...that's just madness.  
Why aren't they a pile of chrome bumpers ran through a blender and stacked in a humanoid shape you mean?
What did they look like before?
It wasn't hard, they just thought they'd look really goofy on the big screen. I know there's a huge hate boner for the Bay designs,  but the 80's stuff looks like what a cartoonist in the 80's **thought** an alien robot would look like. Not what an advanced robot would *actually* look like, and certainly not one that wanted to hide in plain sight. 
What if it’s just bangs without the rest of the hair?
I'm a sucker for classic Beetles
Yeah I don’t care what anyone says about the 1st, it was really great. Such a fun movie to watch once in a while.
Wait, Kelly Fremon Craig had a hand in this? 


Edge of Seventeen is simply fantastic. 
Edge of Seventeen was fantastic. 
When you have strange sci-fi worlds, aliens, monsters, or vehicles that turn into robots, you need a human who can take the viewer through the story with them. Generally speaking. I’m sure there are some exceptions, but usually you want a protagonist who the viewer can project themselves onto.

It helps the viewer from feeling lost or overwhelmed. And a young girl who is coming of age is better than Mark fucking Wahlberg and his stupid ass “story”.
Cliche is a step up from the previous movies, though, where every character only existed to deliver awful, crass comedy, and the autobots were all psychopaths or schizos.
lol. hey man :D
I reckon it is going to be the 'xmen first class' style thing, where they never officially call it a reboot, but set it in the past and only take the parts of continuity that they care about, and ignore the rest
Sector Seven
> Section Eight

lol
Man I hope they use Soundwaves emotionless voice as well.  

"Razorbeak....Ravage....Attack..."
As long as Cullen is alive having anyone else do Optimus would be complete suicide from the fan base.  Same with Frank Welker.  I am not sure (haven't looked) if he voicing any of the Transformers in this movie, but he should be.
Looks like they have BBs voice actor from the first movie too
No one can tbh
How can you take on someone you can't even see?!?!?
With the power of love nothing is impossible 
Most likely gonna die after said face turn. 
YOU GOT THE POWEEEEEEEEERRRRR

#YEAAAAAAH
Spoilers, man.
Aww c’mon - Bay gave them personalities... albeit most were bordering on outdated racial stereotypes... but personality nonetheless.
Here's hoping G1 Megatron is also in the movie, and just hasn't been revealed yet.
>Voiced by Frank Welker, of course

&#x200B;
> Besides, human intervention helping the Autobots turn the tide against the Decepticons is an established part of the franchise and has been there since the beginning.

Aren't the Autobots almost always the verge of losing the war on Cybertron in every incarnation?
It'll be essentially the jungle book movie, but with gigantic robots 
...CONSTRUCTICONS INFERIOR
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsLcTtCrqwg
Frank Welker was basically doing his Dr. Claw voice for Soundwave, but it was heavily processed with a vocoder. Soundwave's first appearance in the Bay films when he's a satellite doesnt use the vocoder, so it really just sounds like Dr. Claw. 
Its not Starscream. Its confirmed to be Blitzwing.
The studio watched Iron Man's funky Bleeding Edge armor grey goo transformation and were like, "Well, if you're going to give the middle finger to physics and engineering porn in a movie with Iron Man in it, guess that makes room for us to fill the void and stop throwing silverware in a wood chipper and filming it."
Well they couldn't go back on the turtles look, but man did Bebop and Rocksteady look great. 
Wheelie say, find friends today!

ME GRIMLOCK SAY, WE ON OUR WAY!
I'm leaning towards a soft reboot, since optimus doesn't seem to be on earth yet and he arrives in Bayformers 1.
This actually seems more like a hard reboot. While it’s awesome to see the G1 designs for this movie, I think they chose it for more than just nostalgia. It represents a clear and visually distinct separation from the Bay movies.

Also there’s no way in hell you can logically explain why the transformers go from these blocky and simple designs to the complicated and (I’m being literal here) edgy designs of the Bayverse versions. The visual separation is too much.
[A Seaboot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iv-U-wDAT_k)
Yeah when I heard he was attached I became a lot more hopeful. Kubo got me tearing up a few times so I'm pretty optimistic about this film atm
AND was the lead animator on almost all of the other Laika films.
This is the first I’d heard of this, and actually gives me a little bit of faith that this might actually be decent
>It may end up being a great movie, but if not, it'll at least be a decent family film. I'll be there opening weekend either way.

It's going to chop the legs out from under Aquaman that's for sure
> The director of Kubo and the Two Strings is directing this film...



>... moving audiences to tears.


Sounds about right.
Does that mean Matthew McConaughey will be playing a Japanese guy in this?
My mom was crying at the first trailer, and she knows nothing about the transformer universe. 
> The director of Kubo and the Two Strings is directing this film 

Ok now I am sold. Kubo is one of the best animated movies I've ever watched.
Oh great, that means Bumblebee is a goner.
Advanced Test Screening of this was surprisingly amazing. Tearful and actually a better Transformers film than the others before it.
I cried when I saw the main human in the trailer. I'm a 27 year old nerd, but i remember 11 year old me never would have believed a girl could be a hero in. Transformers movie.

edit: Downvote me all you want. Being there for the hero to oogle and romance isn't being a hero. Getting a single good jab at the villian isn't being a hero. Being something that's cute and needs rescuing by others isn't being a hero. I'm glad to see a female character with a personal bond to the main characters, a girl who loves transformers, not just someone along for the ride, or who's just attached to  gimmick characters. I'm going to buy every toy in this movie line. 
Bay’s movies became overseas cash printing machines dressed up as thinly veiled action movies. 
The movies got progressively cheesier as they went on and it really hurt the franchise. It sounds dumb to talk about jumping the shark in movies centered around transforming alien robots, but it seems like that's what kept happening in them. They introduced lame elements to keep fleshing out the lore and tie Earth and Cybertron together. It seems like every iteration was trying to add some even bigger and older piece of transformers history on Earth to force the backstories of two worlds together.

They could have left ALL of that out, and then revealed in the 5th movie that Earth was actually Unicron or something and it would have been a legitimate wow moment. Instead it was "transformers actually crashed here a century ago, so crazy. Oh wait but actually they were here during a way earlier point in human history and somehow cave men fought them off. But wait, actually the progenitors of the transformers are the ones who killed the dinosaurs. But wait, did we mention medieval transformers and dragons!? Oh by the way, Earth is Unicron. Oh you already guessed that was going to happen because we keep forcing increasingly idiotic backstories into the films? oh. "

I think Age of Extinction was a temporary step up, if only because Marky Mark was a refreshing change of pace for a lead. But it's pretty clear the second trilogy is following the same tropes as the first and getting further away from the charm that the first movie brought. Also, please stop adding shitty transformers characters that are just walking memes. The first movie had transformers with personality. The lame humor was there but it was balanced with a little style. Every character introduced since has been eye-roll inducing.
Yeah, the first movie is the best thanks to the boy and his car story that the whole thing is built around. 
First ones goodness can be attributed to Stephen Spielberg's producing. 

The rest are all Bay and shite for it
The Multiplayer of Fall of Cybertron was so much fun.
High Moon still exist, they were never dissolved. They faced layoffs after they made Deadpool, but have worked on Destiny and Destiny 2, alongside Bungie, and have built the studios' numbers back up after success there. There was a nice profile on them in this month's Edge magazine.
>The rights to making a game are also a bit iffy, the old games have been pulled from Steam and other storefronts. 

That's just a thing that happens with a lot of Activision's licensed games. All of their Marvel games (The X-Men Legends games, Ultimate Alliance, X-Men Origins Wolverine, every Spider-Man game during the 2000s, High Moon's Deadpool) are also gone from Steam and other digital storefronts.
Well both☺. I did mean Shockwave. Seeing Soundwave was cool but I am more excited to see Ravage over him.
Honestly that scene was fucking dumb but also fucking hilarious and I'm glad it made the final cut somehow.
*Gonggggggg*
Stop lubricating the man!
Excuse me sir you seem to be leaking coolant at an alarming rate, would you like me to seal that up for you?
Think you mean Snarky Snark
There were some badly centered shots with no one in them, but I didn't see him either
I saw some potato salad in there though.
The director or someone did that to make people aware of those laws since his son was in the same situation, iirc.
Remember the minstrel show robots from the second movie?
At least this trailer literally starts by saying the girl turned 18 today....
It wasn't a '5 minute joke'. The entire scene lasted maybe a minute, with the 'card' reveal lasting barely 10 seconds.
I was waiting for something like that to come up in the trailer when the girls says she's 18.
I do remember that, but that was just one time and it didnt ruin the movie. For me atleast.
Not fucking. It’s *making woof*
I chuckled. 
I heard he's in this but you can't see him.
He's listed in the credits but doesn't look like he was in the trailer.
Thrice in a lifetime match at WrestleMania imminent if that happens.
Transformers/GI Joe crossover  when?
I hope he's the President.
I haven't cared about Transformers since the first live action film, and the over design of them really is distracting. Seeing some of the classics in there, especially Optimus, made me kind of excited. It's nice to see those! 
No disservice to Bay, I love his flashy work, but this is from the guy who gave us Kubo and was Lead Animator on almost all of the other Laika films; there’s going to be a ton of heart going into this.
And Starscream looks [like Starscream](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/De6hrdTUEAAGw4W.jpg), and not [a giant metal Dorito](https://tfwiki.net/mediawiki/images2/thumb/d/d6/RevengeOfTheFallenStarscream.jpg/350px-RevengeOfTheFallenStarscream.jpg)!
And now we're in a weird place where Covenant doesn't look like it's getting a sequel and Alien 5 doesn't look like it's happening either.

Thanks Ridley. 
Huh? Blomkamp had made nothing though IIRC, he was just in the planning stages, Scott's return had nothing to do with him (hadn't he made Prometheus long before Blomkamp became in any way involved?)
What does this have to do with anything?
I think it's so perfect as a send-off to the franchise that I can't imagine Vaughn actually doing it better.

But maybe a movie set between the two and directed by Vaughn would've been really cool?

It could've followed Magneto and his Brotherhood and dealt with all the JFK stuff talked about in the movie, instead of killing off nearly all of Vaughn's new characters.
He’s apparently a real asshole and very intense on set but the people I’ve talked to end up excusing it with he has a specific vision so he gets intense about making sure it goes on the screen how he wants it.
Yeah, I get not liking the movies, but nothing I've not heard anything about the guy himself that puts him in a bad light.
Right, fixed
It has been a while. But every now and then I hope on and still get a game. They have a hard core fan following steam. Check steam charts to see when peak hours are. Most likely a good pick up after seeing this trailer.
To be a devil's advocate, I kind of liked the US military porn.  It was a lot of fun seeing 'murica rain freedom on the Decepticons :D.

Also, it made the humans more of a threat since they tend to be meat shields in the Transformers franchise.
well... the bar is set really low, i think its pretty safe to bet that this movie is gonna be better than the last few Transformers.
Director of Kubo, so I feel safe in assuming.
I swear to God, if the fight scenes don't look like that tangled mess of random cords that have followed me into three different apartments, I'm gonna be pissed.

Fifty years from now,  
when you're looking back at your life,  
don't you want to be able to say  
you had the guts to get in the car?
First movie really was great and a genuine family film and crowd-pleaser for all 4 demographic quadrants. 

Some people think that most of the T1 love is due to nostalgia of watching it as a child, but I personally was 24 when it came out and still will watch it when it’s on TV, and some parts still gives me goosebumps. 

Then again, **the first one was the only one where Spielberg actually did anything hands-on**; the part where Sam first sees BumbleBee in all his statuesque glory is a 1000000% Spielberg-inspired/sourced/copied shot (low angle shot, character fixated on an off-screen spectacle, feeling of childlike wonderment with mouth agape — basically Sam looked at BumbleBee the way that Alan Grant and Ellie looked at the Brontosauruses in Jurassic Park). 
It's like paramount went and said "you know what would make us a ton of money with a franchise? Actually making a good movie"
That’s what cast members and several articles online have mentioned. But apparently that isn’t enough to be excited for because she doesn’t have an official writing credit. So take that information with a grain of salt. But yes, I too am excited with her involvement, in any capacity.
>the autobots were all psychopaths or schizos

Not to mention stereotypes.

- ‘Murican autobot: fat prospector
- Japanese autobot: samurai
- Australian autobot: bogan/trigger-happy murderer
No X-Men First Class was always a prequel. It wasn’t until DOFP where they on screen showed the characters rebooting the first 3 movies and making non of it matter,
A radio? 
Where is CM Punk when you need him?
trumpet.jpg x 4
Well yeah that's how you become the champ
I bet Roman Reigns shows up at the end and buries him
Not against John Cena no

John Cena > Love
Nah, he's gonna take a DDT on cement, somehow recover in record time, and take out the last two Decepticons with his bare hands.
"Whoa, did that robot just turn into a giant gun?!" 
Yeah, and then they get to Earth and human assistance helps them.

People need to learn that human intervention is endemic to the Transformers franchise. I can't recall a single Transformers incarnation where they aren't paired up with humans except Beast Wars. And that probably isn't what people want in a Transformers movie, along with being financially impossible.
Not quite. The G1 Autobots lost control of Cybertron to the Decepticons, but that gets flipped around when the animated movie rolls around, and Unicron kicks the Decepticons off the planet. The Rodimus Prime-led Autobots control Cybertron and the Decepticons hide out on Chaar. Most of the reboots use the "Autobots losing" premise, though, so we get to cheer for them as the ragtag underdogs.
The original G1 cartoon started with the war at a stalemate because both sides were short on energy, although the Decepticons seemed to have the upper hand.

*Beast Wars* had the Maximals as the outright rulers of Cybertron, with the Predacons at a truce and Megatron as a rebel.
JB's budget was $180 million. Most Transformers movies had a similar budget except for The Lask Knight which had a $260 Million budget.

A fully CGI Transformer movie would probably cost 2x times that, and I'm not sure if Paramount would green light that, especially after TLK's failure. 
"who are you calling inferior?!"  
"no one would follow an uncharismatic bore like you!"
You mean his [Darkseid?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1SMYNp6qgc)

Which is only to say, he used that voice a lot. 
Frank Welker is still around, so he's hopefully voicing him :).
The Bleeding Edge armor is a natural evolution of the character though. I mean, if you look at how the armor designs have advanced through each movie to reach this level of advancement (which by the way is comic-accurate) , it's quite logical for the character. Plus, it's not like the armor doesn't have have scientific foundation. Sure, nanotechnology isn't advanced enough yet to accomplish the feats it does in Infinity War but it does have limits. You see that when you destroy chunks of it, then the volume of the nanobots reduces overall and he has to compensate on which areas of his body he wants the armor to cover.
I'd argue that that this trailer is more like the first Iron Man movie than the most recent armor.
bumblebee was always the one who arrived first
Because this is set before that film in the early 80s... its the story of how Bumblebee was here first. Why hes a beetle when Sam finds him.
I don't think they would reboot a major movie series literally a year after the last installment. That's way too soon, even for Hollywood. This is definitely a soft reboot. 

Besides, they don't need to logically explain anything. The other movies contradict themselves all the time but are still part of the same canon. Like how Megatron went to Earth to chase after the Allspark, but was apparently also going to go to Earth anyway to meet up with Sentinel Prime. Or how Megatron chasing after the Allspark was a daring suicide mission even though there were Decepticons hiding in the moon the entire time. Or how Stanley Tucci plays two roles for no reason and it's never commented upon again. The point is there are weird plot holes and unexplained occurences in this series all the time, so the character designs changing from blocky to edgy/busy hardly constitutes a reboot. 
Well Bernie Macs lines to Shia LaBeouf from the 2007 movie are straight up in the previous Bumblee trailer, so there’s already somewhat of a connection to the Bay canon ruling out a hard reboot.
"Logically explain". Its easy... you don't. Its a visual change. There is no story reason to it. Same reason Warmachines actor completely changes from IM1 to IM2. Theres no story reason to it.
Same! Great choice of director to finally reboot this franchise the right way. This is what Paramount should have done from the beginning. It's also a much smarter way of building a Transformers Cinematic Universe. Just focus on making great solo movies for each hero, then build up to a big team up movie (in this case, a War for Cybertron movie). Maybe that writers room they assembled some years ago actually resulted in these plans. And with The Last Knight failing at the box office, this is a much needed franchise reboot to turn away from Michael Bay's godawful takes.
AND he’s the CEO of Laika, his dad owns Nike, and he was also a rapper named [Chilly Tee](https://youtu.be/McWU6N_PdV4)
Yesh moar animators pls.

Seriously though, I've adored Laika's work for years.
Did you not see the last one?
Was Deadpool that much a of failure for them?
For what it's worth, I live by their office and they still have their sign up.  Hopefully they're still working on things
That has specifically to do with Marvel rather than Activision. They pulled the licenses over time, so Activision couldn't sell them anymore.
Oh, my bad. I thought you meant that specific scene. Shockwave does look awesome, though!
The movie was definitely already painfully bad, I can't make the argument that removing robot testicles would have helped it much. 
Yeah, there wasn't any intro music for him, either, so I'm not entirely convinced he's attached to the project.
This makes it weirder. 
“My son’s not a pedo! Honest!!”
Yep. What was funny about that situation was how they knew how bad it looked. They got called out, the writers immediately confessed to knowing how bad it was, and Bay dropped those characters never to be seen again.
I remember being called a racist for pointing it out.

Because I was 'applying racial stereotypes to otherwise ethnic neutral robots,' my relatives told me. :|
What? Link?
Any amount of time arguing about rape laws is too much for a Transformers movie.
Found Michael Bay. 
It *felt* like five minutes; it was really awkward, and seemed to serve no purpose beyond making the daughter's love interest seem creepy.
That seems pedantic. The movies are full of bottom-of-the-barrel jokes and I was using hyperbole. Bumblebee pisses on a guy in 1, Jazz talks in outdated ebonics like "yo yo homie what's up," there's a giant robot with testicles in 2, a small robot humps someone's leg. These are just from cloudy memories of seeing them once each and them being really hard to remember in general.

My point was more that they dialed the zaniness and aggression up to 11 for every single character and it made for a really grating tone. This movie seems to fix that.
You’d think so, but that’s not Starscream. 
its blitzwing..
The Decepticons from Bay's movies always looked like someone took a big magnet and dunked it in iron filings. 
That isn’t starscream in the trailer bro
I did like prometheus when viewed as a standalone sci-fi film, but yeah it has no place in the Alien franchise and Covenant was just straight up dogshit
The Alien storyline universe wrote itself into a corner like the DCEU did
I read absolutely no press about Alien Covenant before seeing it, so I didn't participate in the negative backlash before viewing. I really liked that movie...
Bryan Singer walked away from the franchise until Vaughn breathed new life into it with First Class, so Singer decided to jump back on board for DOFP. Not sure if Vaughn was planning to do another, but he'd definitely set the franchise down a fresh new direction, and DOFP (as good as it was) brought it straight back to where it was, writing future entries into a bit of a corner.
Jesus Christ, the contrast is insane. I wasn’t quite as amazed by the new designs as everyone else until I looked at the old ones again. So, so much better.
The driver don't pick the car, the car picks the driver.
Omg that was an amazing line. I forgot.
Yea, maybe she is a script doctor. 


And even though she does have a second project lined up, I *really* do have a wish to see her do the Supergirl film mooted about. 
Matthew Vaughn treated it *First Class* as a reboot, though - he wasn't concerned with making details match, so there are some substantial inconsistencies with what was established in the original *X-men* trilogy.
Except for all the stuff like emma frost being a teenager in origins wolverine, and a bunch of other stuff. The xmen films have never given a shit about continuity errors

Sadly, getting his ass beat in mixed martial arts.
somewhere in wicker park in Chicago. 
And then take out the entire Decepticon army on Cybertron with a tag team partner like maybe Randy Orton?
>with humans except Beast Wars

At least not until later in the series.

Never forget "Code of Hero" 
"Hey, nobody calls Soundwave unchrasimatic!"
This is gonna be pure speculation on my part, so I apologize if I sound like a dumbass who doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

We live in an age where word of mouth can either bring something to major success or cause it to die. The Bayformer films, while always successful, have been declining in box office numbers drastically in the last couple of films, which signifies something needs to be done to bring the films back into being huge successes.

If the Bay films kept going in the same direction, word of mouth about how bad the films are would eventually kill a ton of interest in the series, hurting the brand overall.

Now for why I think story wise a reboot needs to be done, the Bayformer films have a problem where they’ve killed off nearly every character people were familiar with, with the only legacy character left being Optimus, Bumblebee, and Megatron. If they want to make merch of more beloved characters like Star Scream and Rachet, they’re gonna have to do a reboot in order to advertise them through the movies to sell merch.

A reboot is healthy for the movies as it basically brings back everybody they’ve killed off and allows them to be more cautious about not writing themselves into a corner.
Why does every fucking thing have to be a cinematic universe now?


... if... if they do a war for cybertron movie.. and it’s good... I’d have to question if I entered an alternate reality.

Yeah, that's [the exact same thing 
that happened with Activision's Transformers games](http://m.ign.com/articles/2018/01/11/why-activisions-transformers-games-are-no-longer-available-digitally). Activision lost the license to Transformers.
Must be voicing one of the transformers.


The entire rest of the movie should have been everyone giving that character side-eye.

Including the Decepticons.
No it make it fine. LOOK AT THE PAPER
It was fun to watch every person a part of the creative process pass the blame off to someone else. I haven’t seen disownment like that since a trial for a war crime. 
One of the robots had a gold tooth and talked about how he dont like reading. 
Not to mention the ass and downblouse shots of underage characters 
I still refuse to believe that. It has to be a clumsy attempt to swerve fans, like when J.J. Abrams swore Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't playing Khan in STID. There is no way the filmmakers could possibly be so stupid as to design a Transformer that looks exactly like Starscream and call him Blitzwing.

EDIT: My completely baseless theory is that Starscream shows up as the big bad at the end of the movie when the other two Decepticons can't get the job done. This was meant to be a surprise for fans (kind of like a certain bad guy showing up in Deadpool 2), but the movie trailer guys didn't get the memo. So the filmmakers freaked out and made up the whole thing about Blitzwing to try to lead fans astray.
That is a surprisingly accurate description.
So weird....
Wait, what?
But is that not Starscream on Cybertron standing behind Shockwave?
What you didn't like Prometheus setting up a confrontation with humanity's and the xeno's creators, only for Covenant to go "sorry, they ded, lol."
Prometheus. Movie where they decided A, B and C needs to happen but they didn't really figure out a way to do it so they made the characters do incredibly stupid shit.
I didn't like Prometheus that much when it came out, specially with all of the dumb "it's not connected to alien!" PR crap before it released, and all the other myriad of issues everyone has talked to death already. But eventually it grew on me, and I think it's a decent addition to the franchise, specially if you look at what it tried to do and get past the dumb stuff (which isn't easy tbh).

I hate Covenant and the more I think about it the more I hate it. For a movie that tackled much less deeper themes than it's predecessor it somehow managed to come across as more smug and pretentious, all while shitting on both the fans of the original AND the fans of Prometheus.

"I'll do the fingering"

You sure did Ridley, I just wish you had used any other finger than the middle one. Fucker.
Vaughn was attached to direct DOFP but dropped out to do Kingsman instead. Singer coming back for DOFP is what convinced a lot of the original cast to return too IIRC. Plus Singer was executive producer on First Class and had a heavy hand in its scripting and development and was attached to direct for a very long time (he only left as he chose to direct Jack The Giant Slayer instead which he felt it to be creatively different to films he'd done before). While Vaughn rewrote the script when he signed on, a lot of the groundwork for First Class had already been set. 
He was attached at first, but then he left because he wanted to make the first Kingsmen movie, so it wasn’t too bad of a loss really.

Edit:
Also a lot of the Past storyline in the movie was based on what Vaughn had planned (I know the setting of the 70s and some ideas like Magneto accidentally being responsible for the JFK assassination were his)
Bryan Singer was a writer and producer on First Class. He never really left and he only directed DOFP because Vaughn decided to do Kingsman instead.
X-men First Class is still the best X-men team film.
I don’t mind this though because DoFP imo is one of the most perfect and best comic book movies of all time
RIP Bernie Mac
No sacrifice, no victory

money. why else?
Besides the obvious answer (money), I just flat out enjoy them more. There's more to chew on (if it's good like Harry Potter or Marvel). Things are connected and it makes the universe these movies take place in, feel like an alternate dimension you get to peak in, more so than a standalone film. If it's done well, it elevates that film and others connected to it. If it's done poorly, you get DCEU and The Mummy, lol.

Yeah but can he with both feet together leap over a man's head?
As in being a Merchant Prince who funds the arts with a pocket full of billions, then yes.
Laika films are basically just massive art projects. Each one gets a $60 million dollar budget, they're weird with niche audiences, they never make even double their budget, but they've also never gotten below a 75% on rotten tomatoes. And thankfully, no matter how few people see the films they keep coming. I adore Laika, even if their movies don't always land with me. I'm just happy they keep stop motion alive and get to do their thing. 
EVEN ON CYBERTRON, THIS IS CONSIDERED QUESTIONABLE AT BEST

"YEAH THAT'S JUST YOU IMPRINTING RACIST STEREOTYPES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY EXIST!" - Almost verbatim response I received.

If I'm watching transformers I want ass and down chassis shots of ancient robots!
Which one was this? Fox and that model that replaced her were of age. The only one I can think of that wasn't of age is the girl in the latest train wreck.
I think Starscream is actually in the trailer, to the right of Shockwave, and I don't think it could be "Blitzwing" because Skywarp is there too and looks just like Starscream.

Edit: wait, the "Starscream" on Cybertron looks exactly like "Blitzwing" on Earth, though... Maybe they are trying to mislead us, because that's clearly Skywarp sharing the design of the Deception next to him; it wouldn't make much sense if it was Blitzwing.
Again, you’d think so, but he’s shown as a triplechanger and certainly doesn’t sound like Starscream when he speaks. I have no idea why they would put Blitzwing in Starscream’s colors/body, but that looks like what they’ve done. 
Tell me about it xD
I really don't understand the hate for Covenant. It is about the looming dangers of AI, and I felt like it succeeded in portraying a dramatic story with meaningful character arcs. Is everyone really mad about it just because they didn't get to see a confrontation with the Perfect Squidwards explaining why they made everyone? I thought it was obvious that the "meaning of life" would never be explained.
You know, everyone says stuff like this but I didn't really like First Class. Magneto nazi hunting was great (could do a whole movie with that), and a few other characters were good but the villain was boring and they wasted an interesting mutant in Darwin (imo). 
IT'S JUST ME, PRIME!
Stop! I can only get so Nostalgic!

This is a great point! The whole alternate reality thing is so cool. Even if a movie is somewhat mediocre, it can be elevated by being a apart of a larger scale universe 
Read that in G1 Starscreams voice
YOUR MISERABLE ORGANIC OFFSPRING SHOULD STEER WELL CLEAR OF THIS OVERSIZED ADOLESCENT 
I read that in Peter Cullon's voice.
Gets your oil flowing, doesn't it?
>Underage *characters*. 

Mark Whalberg's daughter in that movie was supposed to be 17 but the camera was zooming in on her ass in shorts 

Not sure how old Fox was supposed to be but I think they were in high school
Aren't there like 6 nearly identical plane Decpeticons in the old toy line? They were just repaints, they could do anything they want to tweak those for this, maybe have this be where Starscream stands out or something 
Blitzwing is to the left of Shockwave.
The triplechanger isn't the right color, it's more of a magenta rather than red, [it looks like the one on the far left in the Shockwave scene.](https://imgur.com/ET8eix4) That one is the same color and has the shoulder wheel thing.
I'm just getting ready for Thursday - going to see the cinematic release of the remastered 1986 movie!
my pistons are lubricated just thinking about it
Oh I gotcha, the characters are being portrayed as underage. I thought you meant the actresses at first. 
Whaaaaaaaat
UHHHHHH....WE NEED MORE INFO ON THIS!

Edit - Wow, apparently, it's getting shown in theaters across the country for one night only and only a single showing (7:30pm) remastered to HD.
