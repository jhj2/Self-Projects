Someone pointed this out when Love, Simon was released, but representation is a good thing, even if the genre isn't your thing.  It can be a stepping stone to better things.  Love, Simon was basically a John Hughes movie for gay kids.  Crazy Rich Asians doesn't have to be your thing, but it is still a big deal to have an all-Asian cast not having to play to stereotypes.  
Well I think I've seen the whole movie. 
I feel like I've definitely seen this movie before, just with all white people instead, for a random fictional European kingdom. Hell if I can remember the name though.
I actually remember the book being a very fun read so maybe this won’t be the disaster everyone thinks it will be.
As a huge fan of the book, the trailer was kinda underwhelming.
After Black Panther, it is the time for Asian Pride.
It looks cute. It also has makes me so happy to actually see a character laugh and react to a joke, I feel like it is so rare nowadays especially as quippy dialogue gets more and more common. 
rich guy/ poor girl  
kdrama has done this to death
Saw an early screening for this a while back, it definitely caught me by surprise! Really heartwarming and actually pretty damn funny throughout. I'm always glad to see more Asian representation on the big screen :)
I'm super-stoked to see this! Constance Wu, who plays the lead named Rachel, is terrific on Fresh off the Boat.
No love for us super broke asians?
As someone who's living in Singapore, I hope they showcase the country properly. 
Small gripe. Was kind of bummed to hear Macklemore in the trailer. We're celebrating the fact that this movie has an entirely Asian cast. Would be cool to let someone like Rich Brian or Dumfoundead get some shine.
They're missing the biggest Asian American star, Emma Stone! WTF, this movie is going to suck now.
I'm so used to seeing Michelle Yeoh kicking ass I barely recognized her as a regular everyday person.
The ghetto Asian friend is so cringey. 
Darn, was hoping this was about all the young rich Asian kids you see around Seattle and Vancouver driving Maseratis as students.
I really want to see more of Astrid, Eddie, and Kitty! Those three were my favorites from the books, so I really hope they got them right. 
I made it a point to see Better Luck Tomorrow when it hit theaters so long ago, along with The Debut. Can't wait to see and support this one
The trailer is okay but I am excited about the movie, it has pretty decent cast but I am cautiously optimistic about the director.
So excited for this, this is one of my favorite books ever! I hope the movie is better than that poorly edited trailer, though. 
I thought this trailer was poorly edited. Haven’t read the book but I feel like they’re giving away the emotional climax of the film... I’m looking forward to it though. It’s really weird to see an Asian cast with a pretty big movie budget. 
I love the book so I can’t wait. I hope it’s decent. Btw, anyone else bothered by Awkwafina’s wig? Idk why they didn’t just use her normal hair tbh.
TIL everyone in Singapore speaks English with an American accent.

On a more serious note, having read the book I feel like something's just off with the trailer, like it doesn't quite capture the tone of the book. The extreme extravagance and bitchiness isn't here, so I guess for now I'm still cautiously optimistic. 
I am so excited for this Asian rom-com. I really enjoyed the books and I don't care if it'll be a mess, I want to see this movie more than once. Representation matters and as a South East Asian overseas Chinese (who spent secondary school onwards in the west), I have never felt so much representation in a hollywood film in my life?! ~~*Is this what it feels like to see your race on screen often? * crossing this out because it's a personal sentiment that is disrespectful to other Asians. Definitely could've worded this much better.~~  

It's so nice to see an Asian not doing martial arts or being the nerdy friend. It's so nice to see a whole range of us.

Edit: I should've worded that better. My bad, definitely. In my personal experience, it's because I grew up in South East Asia for a few years and was sent to study elsewhere, but even when I was a kid I was exposed to more hollywood products growing up. I grew up watching the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. It's not very often that those big budget hollywood studios featured Asians.

Now, the Asian entertainment industry is great, but as someone who spent most of their formative years outside of it, yeah I sometimes felt pretty left out around my friends in school when we'd play characters. I remember one girl telling me I couldn't be a spice girl because there was no asian spice. 
Where's Astrid? She was my favourite character in the book
Yes! I’m so excited for this. Love Constance Wu, and I’m half chinese Singaporean so it’s great to see where I grew up on the big screen! And yes it does look a little cheesy, but it’s a rom com. A primarily Chinese rom com. Not all movies with Chinese representation have to be super deep.
I thought it said "Crazy Rich Evans" and I was wondering if RedLetterMedia had made a new film or something.
I loved the books--they are funny and crass and real. I really hope it translates well into the movie. This trailer was poorly paced and edited, but I still have hope for the movie itself! Anything Constance Wu will always be on my watch list.
It's actually a little entertaining watching a bunch of 20-something males who this film is *obviously* not for, freaking out about it and calling it trash.  Like, god forbid this subreddit talks about something other than the MCU for once.  
I am honestly so excited to see this. I picked up the book when it was first released and couldn’t put it down or stop laughing. As an asian America and also coming from the hometown that Rachel (main character) is from and being between NYC, I could definitely relate to so many aspects of her perspective (not dating a rich guy though).

And it’s so refreshing to see asian American actors finally not playing a bullshit stereotype. I’m sure the book is really just a fun novel but this is really, in my opinion, a huge milestone in Hollywood making an all asian cast like black panther was to black people. I hope I don’t offend anyone and in no one am I trying to be racist, I just want to express how good it feels to finally see someone on screen that resembles my background with asian American culture that is finally the main character without stereotypes or being the side character
I feel like this will be one of those films where the supporting characters will be far more interesting than the two leads (Michelle Yeoh and Awkwafina look particularly promising). As a Chinese guy looking for representation in films though I'm really stoked, and it is a very talented cast. 
I would love to see a Harold & Kumar reboot or something similar but this looks promising.
Am I out of the loop or something, why is everyone acting like this doesn't look like absolute shit?
God damn, does Michelle Yeoh age? She looks just as good in that trailer as she did 20 years ago. 

Constance Wu is hilarious and I'm really looking forward to this. I haven't read the book yet so maybe I should check that out before it comes out. 
I guess we're relying on minorities for the RomComs we've been missing out on.

Hopefully it's as good as The Big Sick cause that movie was great. 
I mean this is going to be fantastic. I am so hyped! For my people. My asians!
Shout out to the two seconds of Ronny Chieng. Cool dude 
The sets look absolutely gorgeous. 
I'm pretty sure this is the plot for a ton of Asian soap opera except that the girl is from America instead of the country or some rival family. From my experience of being forced to watch those operas with my parents since 4, I'm pretty sure I know the plot.
This reminds me of a friend of mine Korea. He was a really nice guy, taught English in Korea. He was never one to care about money or anything. You know those types of guys that are just super nice and understanding? Well anyway...he had a crazy ex girlfriend story.

Now after that ex-girlfriend he was single for awhile when he met this nice Korean woman. She was about his age and they dated for 2 years. In Korea it wasn't uncommon to not meet the parents or really know a whole lot about the family until right before you start getting married.

However even with this being said his girlfriend was even more secretive then usual. So they got engaged and life went on. Right before they were about to get married his finance told him he had to move to Seoul after they get married. He objected because he liked where he lived and said he didn't think he could find a good job in Seoul.

To which his finance broke the news to him that her Family was really, really rich and she kept it a secret from him because she didn't want him to marry her just because she was rich. 

Her family is stupid rich, I don't know how much they are worth...but like a year ago she decided to wanted to own a nail salon...so she just bought one. In fact her nail salon is losing money every single month and she doesn't care. She does it because she loves doing people's nails. She doesn't care her overhead is too high, her rent is too high, her prices are too low. 

They take chartered flights for their vacation sometimes, normally 1st class though. He spends quite a bit of time traveling as well he works part time as a volunteer for a non-profit teaching lower income Korean kids English for free.

Recently his dad back stateside got cancer, no insurance. Guess whose footing the bill? His wifes family. When my friend told his wife his dad didn't have the insurance or the money to pay for his treatments she asked how much and they've been sending his dad money ever since. Keep in mind his dads treatments are costing multiple thousands of dollars per month just as base line without any complications. 
[deleted]
I am SO EXCITED FOR THIS. Holy shit! I loved the book and it is SO spot on to the super wealthy in Singapore and HK. Love love love it.
Looks great. I don't know much about the plot but its nice to have asian actors in an American movie and them not be relegated to side story, cheap humour  or martial artist. 

I think there should be cuban american movies, mexican american movies, i think there should be irish american movies, every community should get a chance to shine and tell their own stories rather than the whole pandering by putting someone else down thing the new ghostbusters peeps did.
So. Much. *Hype*! Also, loving the Constance Wu-Awkwafina chemistry as besties. 
[removed]
As long as there is plenty of Astrid I will be happy. She is my favorite character.
None of these people are speaking with a Singaporean Accent. Where is the La?!?
The movie itself looks generic and corny. I think the last time I saw a trailer look so corny was Aloha. 
this movie looks dumb as shit
This looks very different to what I imagine....thought it was going for a slapstick tone.
Currently at work I cant watch the trailer in full or with the sound on but the first transitions totally looked like an asian Sex in the City sequence. 
Lots of shots of him shirtless and it getting shirtless. That’s all I got from the movie.
I wonder the bitching that will happen over this movie.
Monster in Law?
I should really get round to reading the sequel
The man's abs got more screen time than some of the other supporting characters. They should get their own imdb page.
Is this movie about Vancouver?
I saw an advance screening last night, and it’s good! I enjoyed it a lot more than the book. It’s been a while since I read it, but it felt well adapted for the screen — the movie was faithful to the novel’s plot without focusing too much on the minutiae of all the side characters’ stories. Though the trailer doesn’t give it away, Astrid features prominently in the movie.
So does she not have Google in this movie? Was the book written when you couldn't just Google someone you started dating? This movie feels like a outdated movie trope. Like people in horror movies not having cell phones.
A prenuptial agreement would alleviate 80% of the sources of plot in this movie.
Basic romcom, but if the characters are good, then the movie will be fine too...
i thought this would be a dramedy about all those mega-popular Asian youtubers who're making bank.
That looks like a pretty different movie than I expected...I didn't know anything about it other than it was an Asian cast with Constance Wu starring (love her on FOTB), but from the title I expected it to be a sort of a big wild comedy, rather than leaning in so much to the romantic drama angle.
This actually happened to a close friend of my in-laws. Dude was dating a girl who turned out to be part of the royal family and was hiding it. Found out after he proposed. He was just some guy from upstate NY and they got married at an actual castle belonging to her family.
I think they've exhausted most of the East Asian actors in Hollywood for this cast, regardless of where they're actually from. Just missing John Cho and Lucy Liu.
Pretty good movie overall, a little short though.
Wait, wtf where's Scarlett Johansson
/r/justnomil will love it
As an Asian American who barely, if ever, saw Asians on the big screen, this trailer brought a smile to my face the whole time. A WHOLE MOVIE about us. I know progress is slow, but I hope it speeds up. I’d love to see more Asians in all kinds of leading roles in all kinds of movies!!!
Looks god awful 
As a Singaporean I'm a little confused at all the comment saying finally us Asians can have our own shity romcom movie. You guys know Asian countries make their own movies too right? You can literally watch an Asian romcom anytime you want. There's dozens of Taiwanese/Chinese/Hongkong romantic films where every single member of the cast is Asian. And not to mention, it's way more 'authentic' cos none of them are American. 
This seems like a CollegeHumor video, but it feels really weird actually wanting to see this.
Would wanna see it, but Awkwafina or whatever her name is, is so infuriatingly annoying it may ruin the experience. 

Kristen schaal and will forte syndrome. 
Welp.  Now I don't need to see the movie.   I just watched it
It’s gonna be good
Asians that sound Asian and Asians that dont sound Asian. Ay fam this lit 
also recommend Tiny Times if you want to have a fun look into the lives of super rich Chinese teens from a purely Chinese perspective.  it was a huge hit in China when it was released
Buck buck bitch!
I mean in the 80s and 90s we idolized white trust fund kids in movies, so why not Asians in the 21st century?
I almost thought this would be about chinese ex-pats in San Gabriel Valley. A subject worth exploring.
I wonder what this movie is about
They can shoot the sequel to this n Vancouver. 

A good Examination of what all the “Student Homeowners “ clique is like. 
Is this from the past?
At first glance, I thought I read "CRAZY RICH EVANS"... but I'm sure this will be fun, too. 
I thought this was a [satire on rom-coms](https://youtu.be/n0rcpkqvHdI?t=16s).  I was expecting a scene where the Rene Zellweger character trips in front of her love interest.
#shotonvaricam
Honestly, that wasn't Wolf of Wall Street enough
Oh no! He's \*gasps* *RICH*!
looks terrible
The premise of the movie is kind of dumb, they were dating for two years and she never met his family ? 

If that isn't a red flag, not sure what is. 
The story or at least trailer makes this seem like a very generic romcom but I’m all for it if that means increased and moderately accurate representation of all sorts of cultures in Hollywood.

I also hope they call Nick Swaggy P just for the laughs.
Looking forward to the soundtrack
Mmmmmmmeh.
Did anybody else from the title think was going to be like an asain Wolf for Wall Street? Dissapointed to hear it is a rom-com, but I still hope it's good and successful.
In my opinion, true representation happens once all groups get their crappy romantic comedy movies, whether they be White, Asian, LGBT, or whatever.
This^
> not having to play to stereotypes

They still are. Mind you completely divorcing stereotypes from onscreen portrayals is a fool's errand.
But won't this movie just perpetuate the crazy rich Asians stereotype?
I thought rich asian people are a sterotype?
I wish more people knew about Seoul Searching.
Yea I already want to support this and I’m not Asian. 
I don't know how closely this will follow the book, but there are several plot lines that they didn't show at all in this trailer.
There's no way that matters with this specific subgenre.
for a movie like this, it's the journey and not the ending that matters.
It looks pretty generic and unoriginal. I feel like I’ve seen it several times over in other films as it is. 
From the vibe of the trailer, it seems like they're going for a lighter Shades of Grey. I watched on of those movies, and it has the same female wish-fulfilment plot of "ordinary girl falls in love with absurdly rich handsome guy." It's more about the cute romance scenes, extravagant examples of being rich, and just showing a situation a girl would love to be in.
The rom com formula don't crack
Coming to America was the African version.
it is basically a type of british prince movie
Which I'm 100% fine with. That's where equal representation starts. When everyone across the board is making equally bad, generic, and good films. It can be like every other rom-com, beat for beat, but I'm still incredibly excited about the cast. 
It's literally the Asian romcom telenovela template.
Did you read the book? 
This is a short, high production value Asian drama. Do c-dramas have plots like these? I know I've seen kdramas with this *exact* plot.
I think that's the point. "Let's do that thing, but Asian/Asian-American."
I think I remember that. They were in Vlad Peles castle, I had a good laugh about that place being a placeholder for a fictional european kingdom. I am pretty sure I saw some korean dramas with this theme too. But its fairly popular formula, and when done good its fun. 
Its called the Prince and Me and it Stars Julia Stiles....Same movie different races.
King Ralph
Shrek 2?
It pretty much is. 
Christmas Prince
Cinderella? thats what i was feeling.

but it has ms. wu so i'm gonna see it. 
I think you're thinking of Coming to America lol
The bones are the same. It's just the skin that's different.

Which is fitting, I suppose.
I thought it was a satire of rom-coms because it was so completely formularistic
It feels a lot like Pretty Woman in ways.
Ya, same here. 
Same. Where are the subplots and where is Astrid?
Yeah, I’m in the same boat as you. Have been waiting for this movie for a while now, and while I understand that not all plot lines and story arcs will be shown in the movie, the trailer falls flat. I still like the glitz shown in the shots, but I feel like it lacks a certain je ne said quoi
How about an Asian Get Out? It would probably take place at a prestigious US college.
Not to be a killjoy, but a movie where everyone is from the top 1% of the Overseas Chinese population has a long way towards representing "Asians" as a group, tbh. The book series it's based on, while certainly fun, is very much targeted to a Western audience. It's not above using cliched archetypes, relying on Western terms to paint a two-dimensional picture of Asian subject matters (case in point: the William/Harry line in the trailer) and outright butchering cultural elements that the author just couldn't be arsed to do his research on (mostly Malay words and phrases). I'd say that it's about as representative of Singapore as The Wolf of Wall Street is of New York, or the Kardashians are of the US West Coast.

I'm absolutely not saying that it's wrong to celebrate Asian representation in movies, even ones limited in scope like this one. Asian-Americans are right to be proud to see their own thriving in the media, and I'd be absolutely over the moon if this movie could actually inspire more accurate and nuanced portrayals of Asians in Hollywood. But at the same time, I don't think that viewers should put it on the pedestal of "representation" if it ends up relying on thinly-veiled Orientalist tropes to mask elements that are regressive and exclusionary in context. Did you see any Indian or Malay Singaporean face in the trailer? If that level of "diversity" carries over to the final release, it would be tantamount to releasing a movie set in NY or LA without a single black or Latino character. As Kirsten Han wrote in [this essay](https://theestablishment.co/crazy-rich-asians-is-a-win-for-diverse-representation-not-quite-7b93f131fafd) last year, there's a point here where Asian and Asian-American needs for representation diverge, and it would be dishonest for us as viewers to pretend that the movie fulfils both when it clearly only tries to cater to one side.

I'm still cautiously optimistic for the final product, and anything with Michelle Yeoh is a must-watch for me. I'm also pretty excited to see fellow Redditor Remy Hii on the big screen - I don't think of Netflix's Marco Polo as a great representation of Asians as a whole, but I really appreciated the work they put into making the Mongols three-dimensional, and the fact that he actually went to r/askhistorians for research. I'm just hoping that everyone who's itching to see a good portrayal of modern Asians in Hollywood will take care to remember that "Asians" are a mind-blowingly diverse group, and it won't do any good to hold up the movie's core cast as a representative of something they aren't.

(Also, if you're wondering: yes, downtown Singapore really does look [like](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Marina_Bay_Sands_in_the_evening_-_20101120.jpg/1200px-Marina_Bay_Sands_in_the_evening_-_20101120.jpg) [that.](http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/content/dam/gbb/the-gardens/about-us/TheGardens-Introduction-01-1670x940.jpg))
We won’t rest until all races are equally monetized!
Is it though? This seems like a generic Hollywood rom-com celebrating shallowness and worshipping wealth, starring Hiegel or Anniston, except they've been swapped out for an Asian cast.
I am all for this actually
I don't think this will be nearly as good as Black Panther but I'm excited to watch it anyway.

If anything has the opportunity to equal BP's success, it could be the Disney's live action Mulan.
Mongol conquest of Vladimir ? 
So which asian superhero is Marvel using for that movie?
[deleted]
Yeah, I'm tired of these improv heavy comedies where it is mostly just characters riffing on each other, but not actually reacting to what is being said. Like those movies feels more like comedians trying to one-up each other rather than actual characters interacting. 
That's what originally got me into How I Met Your Mother.  The characters actually joked around and laughed at each others jokes.  It goes a long way to show that they actually are friends. 
It looks like I'll like the comedy. Really I hope this movie will be as good as "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" which it reminds me of for obvious reasons. 
Yeah and I'm already excited for that best friend she looks like she'll be a scene stealer.
But this time in unaccented English!

Feels like a big difference to me.
Every Asian drama really.
The books these are based off of are basically "Every Asian TV Drama Cliché: The Novels." 
Except she'd probably not poor, living in Manhattan. More like well off girl meets uber-rich guy.
It ain't a kdrama til there's a death and/or a ghost
Isn't it usually rich girl poor guy tho
But without needing subtitles 
We get plenty of mediocre movies with white casts all the time. I don't see the problem with having more mediocre movies with minority casts.
Agreed! It's a cute rom com that will do wonders for representation. It's not winning any Oscars, but movies with minority casts don't always have to be genre bending as some people like to think.
She's great in that show. Also randall park is amazing in like everything.
> Constance Wu, who plays the lead named Rachel, is terrific on Fresh off the Boat

I love her and will see this movie just b/c of that. 
I think she was on Jay-Z's music video with other celebrities.
That show is seriously underrated. 
She's also a rocket
Anyone here feel like Constance Wu's portrayal of Rachel in this trailer seems to similar to her character on Fresh Off the Boat? The Rachel in my head was quite different. 
Constance Wu is a fucking treasure.
We don't exist
I go yo the movies to escape reality, dude
Define "properly".
No one with a singaporean accent in the whole trailer!
None of those people sounded like they were from Singapore. But then again I have never been there, only met people from there. Maybe rich people talk like that. Who knows. 
Got to have some hokkien curse words to make it legit.
The movie doesn't dive much into Singaporean culture. It's narrative focus is more on detailing the lives of one of the wealthiest families in the world, not so much the lives of Singaporeans at large.
No jaywalking
Remember the time Mission: Impossible 3 ended in Singapore and it looked like the country was still stuck in the 18th century? That was awful hahaha
Rich Brian's got the "crazy rich" aesthetics down, at least.
Don't you mean Scarlett Johansson?
A crazy rich regular everyday person.
I'm still expecting at least one martial arts battle in the movie, most likely in a daydream.  
There always needs to be a sassy/awkward best friend to the main character. 
That's Awkwafina. She's a rapper in NYC in real life. I didn't imagine her character in the books (Peik Lin) speaking that way though. 
That archetype of a character is usually pretty cringey and outdated these days. 
thats awkwafina, i hope she's better than the trailer shows.
But yah can't swerve, you gotta roll up and be like bok bok bitch

*neck roll
I agree. All my ghetto Asian friends are hella cringey, but they think they're cool, but hey, they do they.
Because asian people aren't allowed to talk that way? 
Better Luck Tomorrow (2002, directed by Justin Lin) plays along that line, but loosely based on a [real-life murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Stuart_Tay) in Orange County.
Did you ever catch the Easter Egg to this movie in Harold and Kumar?

When Harold can’t find parking the Dudebros say “Better Luck Tomorrow!”

Always loved that reference. 
Thanks, I was trying to remember the title Better Luck Tomorrow for about 30 minutes. 
The director has made one of the worst movies of 2015 and his other movies are forgettable sequels to forgettable movies and Justin Bieber documentaries. I don't know how anyone could be optimistic about this director.
EDIT: [Oh, here is the Teaser Poster](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DbawL1rWAAAOZq8.jpg:large)
I can't tell if he's a mediocre director or if he just got bad projects to work with. Let's face it, Jem and the Holograms wouldn't have worked for most directors. He made Now You See Me 2, which was blah, but it also had a blah screenplay IMO. I'm probably in the minority, but I liked Step Up 2: The Streets. Not for its brilliant direction, but it's a competently made flick. 

So I'm not sure about Chu's capabilities. I want him to succeed here but I have some reservations. 
Is the book a comedy or melodrama? In my head I was imagining this as more of a comedy based on the logline and general early buzz. This seems super, super dramatic haha. 
was literally in the middle of typing that when i saw your comment.
The rich Singaporean characters are raised with British accents and sound pretty British in the trailer though? Also Awkwafina's character went to Stanford so it wouldn't be surprising for her to sound more American. Michelle Yeoh definitely didn't sound completely American, though she was supposed to sound British in the books. 
The actors speak English fluently without accent but for some reason in this movie they speak in a fake accent that sounds like an offensive sterotype. 
>Is this what it feels like to see your race on screen often?

If you’re not Asian-American, it’s a bit insulting to the booming and active Asian entertainment industry to say that they’re not seeing their faces on screen... Growing up in Singapore, a Chinese person had **no problem** with on-screen representation. Asian-*Americans* however, hell yes, they’ve been getting shafted in Hollywood longer than anyone...
I'd probably prefer that movie. 
The book was like that too. The main male lead Nick was a super generic prettyboy and Rachel was a relatable every-girl, which to be fair was necessary to give the readers a character to identify with amidst the other insanely rich, out-of-this-world characters.
People are excited that Asian people get to star in an absolute shit movie just like white people do.
This reminds me of an Asian Tyler Perry movie.
If you haven't noticed you live in a clown world, you may in fact be out of the loop. 
[asian dont raisin](http://www.bigwowo.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/asian_timeline.jpg).
I don't think the movie will be high cinema, but I could see the material working better onscreen à la The Devil Wears Prada, since instead of spending pages upon pages on tedious descriptions of luxury brands, they can just show it. Plus, they've got a talented cast. 

The trailer is eh, but romcom trailers are all kind of the same regardless of whether the movie's any good or not. 
White people get mediocre rom coms all the time. Let us have one. 
It's based off a book with a pretty sizeable following. Of course it's fans are gonna be excited to see it. Why are you so angered by that you herb. 
lol why are you so angry?  the movie looks cute an enjoyable.  the trailer wasn't great but hopefully the film will be better.
I think people are mainly just happy to be represented in a Hollywood film and I can understand that. However, it does just look like they took any number of older films and slapped an Asian cast on it. And I do think it would be better if the big issue weren't that he's rich. It's likely two hours of wealth-porn with the facade of a story with a heart.

Asian here and honestly not too enthusiastic about the movie especially after having seen the trailer. Maybe romcoms and dramedy just aren't my thing, maybe the movie really is just generic trash. However, you can bet I'll still be quietly rooting for the film and will be seeing it. When was the last time you've seen a Hollywood film with more than five Asian characters that aren't nerds/geeks or martial artists? When was the time you've last seen an Asian-led big budget Hollywood film in the first place?

The key thing here is *representation.* That's why people are excited for this movie. If more Asian-led films come out, it will normalize seeing Asians on the big screen. This will give Asian actors a chance at a wider variety of roles and genres. You get the gist.

I understand that there are those who believe this movie will just paint Asians in a bad light (thus *representation* is futile?) but little steps, I think. Besides, not every movie focused on a minority has to be bleak or an arthouse film (or both) right?
I agree 100% with your comment. This film looks like shit. Its glamorization of wealth is in completely poor taste, any white-centric movie like that coming out today would look appalling to all.

But somehow people here are jubilant. And that's admittedly because the main characters are Asian. Alright, perhaps Asian-Americans feel they *need* this sort of "representation"... But why? Do you really want *that* kind of vain representation? It looks terrible. 

Give me some interesting Asian characters any day. But according to the trailer, this film looks awful, Asian characters or not.
Gemma Chan as Astrid is so perfect!!
Gone, and that's pretty fair. Past a certain level of affluence you get language tutors, international schools, foreign studies, etc. from day one so you never really get the accent. 
Did you enjoy the book though? Because I liked the book a lot more than I thought I would, so if the movie is even better, I might just end up going to see this.
[deleted]
The book elaborates on this, the main character comes from 'old money' meaning they are generations of super rich and they've learned not to flaunt it and keep themselves hidden. Ya know to protect from the media and gold diggers
So in the book the main guy is a super low-key/down to earth professor. His family is considered old-money in singapore and are insanely private. That scene where ken jeong and awkwafina are freaking out about the dude doesn't happen in the book, they essentially don't know who he is because even though they're wealthy too they don't run in the same circles (new money vs old money).

I get a feeling this movie is going to water down a lot of the complexities laid out in the book.
Well, if you're dating someone who seems like a normal person with a last name like Thomson you wouldn't immediately connect them with the billionaire owner of Thomson-Reuters. 
Maybe he uses a different name or something.

Although tbh I have already googled my family members but never my friends or the girls I was interested in
Not everyone googles their friends/acquaintances/love-interest... 
In GITS's defense. The ghost in the shell universe is supposed to be beyond race because you can choose how you look since you are an android. 
"Big Trouble in Little China" was surprisingly super progressive for it's time. It showcases a bunch of Asian Americans that are just regular people in a story and not weird caricatures. The main villain guy is a bit problematic by modern standards, but he's so over the top you don't take him too seriously anyway. 
Just to be clear, you want to see more Asian **Americans**, not Asians, right?
Asia has a whole thriving movie market.

Best movie I saw this week was "The Villainess"
Most of the comments are by Asian-Americans, who rarely see themselves represented. 

There was actually an interview with Awkwafina about how the Asian-Americans in the cast were so excited to be in an Asian cast while Michelle Yeoh didn’t get it at all. 
Shot On VARICAM 
It's a pretty common asian thing.
Truth. Call Me By Your Name would have been better for the gay community if Armie Hammer took a pratfall into a wedding cake.
Haha I’m pretty sure white people have enough crappy romantic comedies
The end of racism comes when it literally does not matter or warrant discussion what race someone in a movie is. They're just there. 
To truly know if it's a crappy Rom Com, we have to see if the film poster is the cast stand to a white background, with the film title in red letters above.
Is the book any good?
I'd guess the movie does not tell the story from multiple POVs
Which of the 100,000 generic books that follow this plot are you talking about?
I guess I was expecting more than a safe and plain romantic comedy :/
It's a romcom, what do you expect?
No no no, this isn't like every other romcom with the same subplot and drama between rich prince falling in love with a commoner.

This time they're *asian*. 
Exactly. The real question is why the fuck does it have 2000 upvotes and how is it on the top of /movies?

HMMMMMMMMM

/hailcorporate
If it's anything like the actual book, there are like zero cute romance scenes. It's just a series of backstabbing and social gaffes and judgement. Think more *Gossip Girl.*
The filmmakers were really happy with that line because it lets people know that it's a happy, romantic story with family issues as the element of conflict. It's one of those function-over-fashion kinds of lines. The art isn't doing any of the heavy lifting aside from showing that they're in love, so the rest of the job falls on copy.
I'm a simple man–I see Coming to America, and I upvote.
That had Eddie Murphy in his prime.  It could have been some stupid movie about the stock market and been amazing.  He was just that good back in those days.
I never thought of Coming to America as a rom-com.
[deleted]
The only issue with this is that if the movie flops executives will go “and that’s why we don’t do people of color movies, everyone hates them” 
Literally all of Asia has this as their cinematic plots.

Even us Indians, though we're particularly fond of love triangles.
Chinese cinema gets shit on a lot, but I feel like they can do an acceptable romcom.
It’s based on a book
There's a short snippet that looks like her and Michael kissing on a bed ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Felt too Gatsby... I felt like that wasn’t the focus of the book but it was 90% of the trailer. 
I was thinking about that before. Hayden Szeto as the lead character perhaps?

On that note, I've always wanted to see something like *Manchester by the Sea*, *Mud* etc. for Asian American actors - intimate character studies where the performances are the main focus. *Columbus* came close to this last year.
As a Korean dude, I felt satisfied watching Get Out. I looked over at my Chinese-American friend and we had the same look when the Asian man at the auction party showed up: "Of course he's Japanese"
How about a sequel to Better Luck Tomorrow? 
We are very accepting of Asian students, 25% of the student body is Asian! *fails to mention they are all in Graduate studies*
It's funny because "Get out" is what the Ivy League admissions offices say to a ton of qualified Asian applicants. 
"Get Out, Too Many Asians"
I'll buy the ticket. I'll watch it over and over again, and drag everyone I know (admittedly, not a lot) to see it. 
I don't think it's trying to be representative of a whole population. I mean with a title like CRAZY RICH ASIANS? It literally is the lighter Asian version of Wolf of Wall Street and I don't think \*anyone\* thinks that movie is "representative of New York". I think everyone understands that movie to represent a small sub culture.
I certainly won't argue with you on the accuracy of certain aspects of this, but shouldn't part of the point of normalizing Asians in American film that they can be and do literally anything in these kinds of movies? Accurate representations of cultures are not necessarily interesting to a wide audience, nor does it necessarily make for a good narrative. I don't say that to be disrespectful, but it's just true. Like you bring up The Wolf of Wall Street. Sure, a lot of things in that movie are exaggerated and if they're not, then it's not representative of any society as a whole, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't believe in the canon of good movies. Or Black Panther. As much care as they put into the lore and the African culture in that movie, there are aspects of that movie that people argue about, in terms of its accuracy. It's fiction. Fiction is meant to be exaggerated. 

I understand the importance of representation and not letting an under-represented culture devolve into bad tropes and stereotypes, but watching this trailer it just looks like a normal romcom to me, and shouldn't that be the ultimate goal?
It is kind of cringy and stereotypical. In this day and age, we should be able to differentiate between the people and cultures of the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Malay, etc. in the same way we would differentiate between French, German, Spanish, etc. IMO the term "Asian" is no more than a 21st century version of "Oriental". Is it that hard to realize that Asia has lots of diverse people?
[deleted]
Thanks /u/veratrin 👋 
>  it's about as representative of Singapore as The Wolf of Wall Street is of New York, or the Kardashians are of the US West Coast.

So incredibly accurate? Got it.
Thank you so much for saying this! As a Malay Singaporean studying in the US, this film just...leaves a bad taste in my mouth, especially because people don't seem to realise how badly Malays and Indians are portrayed in SG media (if we are in them at all), and the racism that Malays and Indians experience in Singapore. I think a lot of Americans just don't understand that Asians can be racist to each other, and that this film is playing into the idea that Malays and Indian-Singaporeans just don't have stories worth telling - and thus shaping a viewpoint of Southeast Asia that does not at all reflect its racial and cultural diversity. It annoys me that people are telling me that this film is important and representative when it's really...not. Like, this film matters more to Asian-Americans than to Asians, in many ways, and I think people need to consider whether it's right to tell the Asian-American vision of an Asian country, rather than that country's own story. I think the film looks great, super high production values and good lines, and I hope it opens lots of doors for the actors involved, but I'm not about to start telling everyone it's some kind of perfect success story in representation because it will never be as good as it could be, to me. 
That ain't downtown tho.
Maybe lock their doors when they enter a house too.
I have a colleague who doesn't say bye before hanging up. I find it hilarious when our conversations abruptly end. They don't even realize that they're doing it.
Maybe it's insecurity from "laughing at your own joke". 
Same, I don't think the show was perfect by any means, but I always liked that if a character said something funny they'd laugh or smile, instead of going like "oh you". 
You described really well why I enjoy New Girl. The reactions to the jokes and the timing really feel like conversations I've had with my friends. Chemistry and timing shouldn't be as underrated as they appear to be in tv sitcoms. It makes the conversations feel more natural.

[This scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0PqaxvS_wo) is full of cuts so it isn't the best example, but the writing on New Girl deserves props when I can give them. 
Also reminds me of a line from 30 Rock when Pete tells Liz "You look like a *fancy* prostitute" because she is wearing a nice dress, and she immediately laughs. It's not even a great joke (especially for the show), but her reaction sells it.
That's also something I love in Bob's Burgers.   
The characters don't just shrug off the jokes, they actually laugh at them like real people.
Yasss that's it. Reminds me of that. Cannot wait.
It's not Asian drama without class drama.
*Every Drama
class warfare in my asian dramas man.
What about people who have something against more mediocre movies in general
Randall Park was hilarious as Kim Jong Un. Maybe if this movie is successful he'll get more comedy roles.
*Family Feud* is one of the best music videos I’ve seen. Such a clean cut. Everyone looks so elegant. Jay-Z and Ava make a good team
idk it seems like it became too focused on the mother 
I accidentally caught it on TV, and it's way better than the awful title would suggest. I also remember laughing pretty hard at a trailer I saw once that seemed super racist.
I was expecting someone a little softer and sweeter, to be honest!
If I see one motherfucker chewing gum, I'm WALKING out!
Plenty of durians.  
Uncle, Whatever was on "under one roof", ok lah?
They love gambling apparently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKMNKS-9ugY
Well, she was about to drink the finger water so I think it practically looks like a documentary.
Lah
Confirm would shill out for an accurate Singlish dub of this movie.
NICE LA
What are you talking about? Everyone's got a fake ang mo accent, totally realistic
Exactly, not a single slinglish sentence. I really miss those sentences that has 4 different languages randomly. I miss living in SQ
Their wealth/ class is definitely the reason why they talk like that. Most of these people were educated from a young age to speak "perfect Queen's English" with a "clipped British accent" according to the book. They also mostly went to college outside of Singapore (Oxford & Cambridge are popular choices). 
I'm under the impression that it is a Chinese family who moved to/started a business in Singapore... and subsequently the kids/grandkids went to the UK and US and some back to HK. And now everyone is coming back to Singapore for the wedding.
And Singapore is multi-cultural. Didn't see a single Malay/Indian anywhere.
Posh Singaporeans generally don't have the typical Singaporean accent.
The movie is centered around one extended Chinese family sprawling around the world. The male lead is British educated, the parents live in Malaysia, cousin in Paris, the bride of the wedding is from Hong Kong I think.
People on the radio seem to speak with regular RP or sometimes Australian accents.
Atleast they didn't make her black!
She’s also gonna be in oceans 8. 
She sounds like she's been smoking Marlboro Reds since she was 2.
Thanks, I'll check it out!
Ha yeah, BLT and Harold and Kumar were two of my favorites thanks to them both busting down Asian stereotypes
I hadn't heard of him before so looked up his filmography.

https://i.imgur.com/4h3lgr7.png

It doesn't really scream quality....

I guess everyone has to start somewhere but his filmography coupled with that poorly paced trailer do not give me confidence for this film. 
Only way is up?
The Step Up 2 is pretty great tbh
Justin Bieber: Never Say Never is actually pretty ok. The subject is insufferable, but the movie around him and the concert itself was pretty well shot and crafted. 
Oh I recognize who you're talking about: John M. Chu, that guy made G.I. Joe Retaliation and that [awesome trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2YMu52MfqA) I don't blame him for Jem and the Holograms that was a mistake all the way around the table. Now You See Me 2 is harder to explain. I was really rooting for him, even his first Bieber Doc is supposed to be pretty good. I doubt he'll bring any of that to this film. Maybe he'll have a good dance scene in there. He's the Justin Lin of the Step Up franchise.
yeah i’ve seen a lot of people claiming he’s great but his career is terrible. what the hell am i missing here?
It's like they're aiming for a super generic Asian romantic comedy poster. I can't tell if they're being tongue-in-cheek or not.
It's a satirical romcom. Basically her boyfriend's entire family makes everything super extra because they're rich and family politicking is their hobby. 
It's basically a rom com, but with asians. You know, typical super rich boyfriend meets regular notmal girlfriend and invites her to see his family. And then shenanigans ensue. 
My friend sent me the casting poster for this movie. I believe the main male lead is supposed to be chinese Singaporean who grew up in UK studying hence the British accent.
I think their accents are pretty spot-on for posh queen's english. Also, the lead guy Henry Golding is English and so are many others in the cast like Gemma Chan, Sonoya Mizuno, Constance Lau (not Wu). Remy Hii and Chris Png are Australian as well. I don't think their accents sound offensive at all since a lot of the characters went to posh private schools. 
I mean, they're pretty clearly talking about this western film within the context of the western film industry.

I don't think anyone is arguing that Asian professionals don't find work within the Asian entertainment industry in Asian countries.
I should've worded that better. My bad, definitely. In my personal experience, it's because I grew up in South East Asia for a few years and was sent to study elsewhere, but even when I was a kid I was exposed to more hollywood products growing up. I grew up watching the Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. It's not very often that those big budget hollywood studios featured Asians. 

Now, the Asian entertainment industry is great, but as someone who spent most of their formative years outside of it, yeah I sometimes felt pretty left out around my friends in school when we'd play characters. I remember one girl telling me I couldn't be a spice girl because there was no asian spice.
Rich Evans as Shoji Tabucchi 
[He speaks fluently in Asian languages so he'd be perfect in this film.](https://youtu.be/3XCFjN80BO8)
I mean, if it's at all like the book, Astrid and Eddie will steal the show in all their scenes anyway. Haha.
It's a pretty bunk premise, I know. The gist of it is, this is an attempt to normalize Asian americans as another subset of Americans in American trope movies, to promote interchangeability in stories without a required ethnic context. To break tropes or have significantly extra uniqueness (usually taken in an ethnic context) again relegates Asian Americans to "we'll use you when [unique context] is needed", and business continues as is, regardless of how successful this film could be.

Downside is, if this bombs (not unlikely), it can bring down a lot of the ship with it.


It's Oxley Road English.
Doesn’t agree. Accent and Singlish are two different things. You can speak perfect English without any grammar mistake with singaporean accent.
Plus the manga author already said she looked Western because Japanese beauty culture looked up to Western female models as standards of beauty. 

Plus there was the whole Japanese girl who died and was resurrected as a white fembot backstory halfway thru the movie.
I love how they had it where Wang Chi was the actual hero while Jack Burton was more of a sidekick.
Both! I’ve only been able to catch a few foreign films playing in indie theaters in LA, but I love seeing all types of Asian representation on the big screen. I know the Asian film market is huge and I can watch those movies any time, but there’s something about the theater experience that is just magical. And I want to see better representation especially in mainstream films! I’d love to see more foreign films playing in theaters too!
yeah we dont live in asia tho. It's important to see the Asian American experience represented. 
Oh definitely lol. They've over-saturated the romcom market, so average romcoms with minorities as the stars seem like giant leaps forward when they're just normal steps lol.
I rarely laugh out loud when reading, but this book definitely made me multiple times. It's like if Downton Abbey and The Godfather had a baby that was a comedy.
It's not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it! It's got a lot of fun characters that are just over the top ridiculous, some of whom you're rooting for and some you're not. It also has tons of descriptions of food/clothes/rich settings, so if that's not something you'd be into, it would probably not be a fun read for you, but if you are, I'd for sure recommend.
My wife who is white and has had to prove herself to upper-middle class, crazy Asians on my side of the family found this book to be hilarious. She would be laughing while we're just sitting around on the couch.
Like Gossip Girl opulence on steroids. LOVE
The first one is. I’m iffy on it’s sequels. 
It's mindless but very entertaining.
I agree, but I still think they'll cover some of Eddie, Astrid, and Kitty stuff and there's some more to Rachel and Nick's storyline as well.
Most movies that come out are not exactly reinventing the wheel plot-wise, but there are elements to the Crazy Rich Asian books that aren't just cookie-cutter.
If you're getting more than that, they did manage to hide something :)
I expect I probably won’t see it. That’s it. I think it might do well though, depending on the release date. 
> It could have been some stupid movie about the stock market and been amazing.

Not sure if intentional, but like **Trading Places**?
Some of Arsenio's best work as well.
> Like we can also have a zombie movie with a gay couple as the main characters

Unfortunately this is exactly the kind of thing that people would scream is forced in for the sake of diversity or to check a box, even if it's not.

It's attitudes like that which create the idea of an other, and it's tiring to me.
This also might sound weird but I feel like the film is also (if only very delicately, almost tangentially) touching upon a topic that a lot of Asians experience but isn't often represented in mainstream films: A cultural disconnect between "Asian" and "Asian-American" experience. And it's there, but the film isn't *about* it per se. 
> a Latino sci-fi movie

Wasn't that Elysium?
>*Like we can also have a zombie movie with a gay couple as the main characters*

Not sure if you realise it or not, but there's actually a movie like that already. For the life of me I can't remember the name, but basically zombies rise up in some small town when a man is visting home to introduce his boyfriend (and come out of the closet) to his family. They have to take refuge in a church at one point, and some nutty preacher thinks its divine punishment and tries to use conversion-camp tactics to try to turn one of them straight to hopefully make the zombies go away.

Another guy in the town thinks its a terrorist attack, and in an act of paranoid racist desperation tries to kill an arab girl too. It's a pretty weird movie. Seems to be more about hateful ignorant people and their reactions to a zombie invasion, rather than a zombie invasion itself.
Spoilers: this movie is actually a zombie movie, you just don't find out until halfway through.
"a Latino sci-fi movie. "

It's called Sleep Dealer. Has a phenomenal soundtrack and an interesting plot with great original ideas. You should check it out 
And then another studio will look at the 10th highest grossing movie of all time and think to themselves "You know, there's an untapped market there that can make us a lot of money if we do it right."

I honestly don't think studios avoid diversity because they're afraid of losing money. I think studios avoid diversity because it's *change* and change represents the unknown and that can be scary.
I love pizza too.
Chinese cinema is great. 
"Gook" was pretty good if a bit under-seen. 
"Better Luck Tomorrow" is what you're looking for.
Columbus was a weird movie

It was well shot and edited together. The performances were good. But the story had too much of a first world upper class problems feel to it. 

The young woman's story line was the redeeming factor. Her story seemed heartbreaking.
There are few things I want more desperately than an Asian-American-led movie in the vein of *Moonlight*. 

*Columbus* has been on my watchlist for a while, I should finally watch it! 
Yeah Columbus was a great, overlooked film from last year. 
There's this incredible thing called "Movies not made in America" and I think they're gonna have just what you're looking for
There's a few movies.  Nothing big.  Have you seen Better Luck Tomorrow, Gook, Saving Face or Seoul Searching?  
Can you explain or go into detail the subtext? I'm a white dude from NJ that has just started to discover the Korean community in North Jersey. 
Fast & Furious 6.
Better Luck Next Week
Get Out: Ivy League version
Yeah, affirmative action and equality sounds great on paper until you realise it's not just white people getting the shaft 😂
New York shows up in every other American movie. For a lot of viewers, *Crazy Rich Asians* is going to be their most in-depth look at Southeast Asia outside of Vietnam War movies, so it's bound to colour their perspectives in ways that *Wolf* didn't.
It's totally okay for it to be a normal rom-com! It's great that Asians can be excited for American movies where they have the spotlight. And I certainly do think that Asians - and any other under-represented group in Hollywood - should be able to make "normal" movies and screw up and keep on making movies without the weight of representation on their shoulders. 

That said, I think this particular representation bears more responsibility than both of the movies we've brought up, for a few key reasons. International movie-goers are exposed to Hollywood on a daily basis - you can expect them to walk into *Wolf* knowing that it is no more or less a portrait of American society than, say, *The Wire*. And yet, it's still a point of contention *to American viewers, especially from minority demographics* when movies of its production calibre fail to portray minorities where you'd expect to see them IRL. For a lot of viewers, *Crazy Rich Asians* will be their single most detailed resource on Southeast Asian cultures, so imagine that feeling multiplied tenfold. *Black Panther*, meanwhile, is clearly aimed at African-American viewers over mainland African ones, but it has the benefit of a fictional setting. Most people didn't walk out of the movie significantly more informed about Yoruba, Dogon or Basotho cultures, but Wakanda isn't a real place populated by those very real peoples. Excluding people from a synthetic setting that exists purely as an intellectual property is pretty different from excluding them from a story set in their real-life home. And I really do admire the love and care they put into representing bits of African culture in the movie, but we'd surely be holding them to a wholly different set of standards if it were set in, say, Sudan, and not Marvel's fully fictional high-tech utopia. 

(These are all observations made from a non-black perspective, so I'd be happy to hear other viewpoints)

I'm not saying that your take is wrong! It's *possible* for a movie to be a refreshing, non-standard Hollywood outing that contributes towards the normalisation of minorities in the media, while at the same time doing disservice to the complexity of its subject culture and erasing its less-represented members. And maybe it does say more about the ethnic stratification of IRL Singaporean society that the ultra-rich *can* live like that without ever being acquainted with minority citizens. But if a movie like this neglects portraying key parts of its subject in the interest of appealing to the widest possible audience, while at the same time still presenting inaccurate bits of their culture for worldbuilding... then that's a form of whitewashing too, don't you think?

I'm not implying that the movie, as a concept, is a moral failure. But it likely had the opportunity to be so much more. It's possible for a movie like this to speak to, say, a Chinese-American student *and* her Malay Singaporean counterpart, without either of them left wondering why people who look like her are only depicted as security guards and chauffeurs. And I'm glad that we can have these conversations here and continue looking at all the ways that representation can work.
I was referring to the characters! There are other actors of non-Chinese ancestry in the cast, but almost all of them portray characters from the same tiny subsection of Overseas Chinese - and if they pull it off, all the power to them.

> This is not true. Its not walkable from downtown

ಠ_ಠ

Where have I been walking on weekends then
Well, if you consider Marina Bay CBD "downtown", it's not that long a walk.
i died. did you just

omg
Accuracy is one thing, but representation is another. If every American had to pick a movie/TV show to describe their life, how many would pick either of those?
Who downvoted this ಠ_ಠ
Well, probably not in this particular movie - when you're that wealthy your security is not in your door locks.
Really? He was a main character in the Office and also got to direct A Quiet Place.
It's funny that he's in both Ant Man and Aquaman this year, does that count as comedy? 
To be fair, it is based on a Chinese family.  Mom or grandma is usually the heart and soul of a Chinese family.  
I guess. I think the show got great feedback on Wu. She is also home more so she has more scenes with the boys and she is Hunnys best friend so she has scenes to keep them involved.
That kind of makes sense since hers was the breakout chracter. The supposed lead - Eddie - was simply not funny or interestng.
Never really bothered me, most people seemed to think she's the best part of the show.  She, the dad, and the youngest son are my favorites.
There are always at least 2 other storylines in each episode focusing on the rest of the family. If anyone, it's Eddie who gets too much focus.
Yes, me too. Constance Wu's Rachel feels a little too sassy! 
If I don't see one rude American getting lashed in the background, I'm burning the theater down!
Not on the MRT!
will the movie be accompanied by a scratch and sniff card?
singaporean or singlish is my favorite accent.
Can
Got already? Don't play play! 
The male lead is half Malay
Except she said "but chu cain't swerve" like a sassy black woman. Don't want to be too critical but it was pretty clear that she's kind of adapted to that stereotype.
yeah that struck me too. ive heard her talk normally too.
Yikes, those are a lot of bad to mediocre movies.
> Jem

OH...oh no...
yikes
Now You See Me is getting a THIRD FILM? WHAT? WHY?
3 is also quite good. 
Gotta get that k drama fanatics. 
you know this is the first time I've actually seen "extra" in this context out in the wild.
He actually grew up in Singapore (only went to the UK for uni at Oxford) but went to private schools where students might've been taught in British English, I think. His mother and all his aunts supposedly speak with a clipped British accent too, and they were taught by "British nuns" in Singapore. The impression I have is that most of these "crazy rich" people, especially members of his "clan", have British accents, or at least, not typical Singaporean ones. 
The "South East Asian overseas Chinese" part just made me want to clarify that other parts of the world **do** indeed have their own entertainment industries, because a Chinese person is not an Asian-American. An *Asian-American* has the struggle of on-screen representation, not a Chinese person with an active entertainment industry in their homeland. In my opinion, it's not Hollywood's job to represent the world, but rather up to the viewer (and ideally, distributors) to expose authentic content from these overseas counterparts.

Edit: I don't mean to sound aggressive in the above, but my ideal outcome is that the world is able to share entertainment with the world, rather than just looking to Hollywood to "fix everything". The West already has so much influence on the world, and I would rather other industries step up and compete rather than Hollywood growing even bigger.
Aiiiiiiiids
Honestly so excited for Gemma Chan and Ronny Chieng's parts!
Lol true. I'm hoping Oliver will be true to the book as well, but he doesn't really get to shine until books 2 and 3 anyway. 
I see what you mean, but in this example it's all about their ethnicity. It's some Asians going to Singapore, meeting their Asian step family and drama ensuing from that. It's completely ethnocentric, like "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" but with Asians, and them being Asians is the whole point, it's even in the title.

When we'll get a character who just happens to be Asian, without their Asian background being a factor, that's when Asians will be normalized in Hollywood. 
Looks like a good chunk of the movie is in Asia.

huh the trailer looks like fifty shades of gry met bride and prejudice
yes, intentional
Actually, there was a zombie movie that had a gay couple as the main characters, [as I briefly discussed in this comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8eb9ff/crazy_rich_asians_official_trailer/dxucdpi/)
Three of the four main characters were white, so no, I don't think that counts.
Nah, [Automata](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1971325/).  It was a pretty interesting watch, I came away with more respect for Antonio Banderas's acting.  He had more range than I'd expected.

(Not saying it's a good movie mind you, but I enjoyed it.)
Well maybe, I'm not saying that movies like these doesn't already exist, I just used them as examples. 
Zombie movies tend to be a commentary on society and how people behave anyway, so it's fitting. 
It's an interesting concept, but the execution sounds way too forced.
Well I just used that as an example 
The Big Sick?
great movie, powerful performances and direction 
A lot of movies have that first world upper class problems feel to it. It is increasingly annoying for me to watch movies where a protagonist will identify themselves as "just a normal guy!" and they are obviously living a life most people can't afford. I appreciate movies like this that address class issues head on - either realistically like Lady Bird or with an absurdist slant like Bridesmaids (looks like that's where this one is going)
Columbus was one of the dullest pieces of visual poetry I've had the displeasure of experiencing. A good half of it is John Cho looking out into the distance, smoking cigarettes and never making eye contact.
If you liked Moonlight (and not because everyone told you to like it) then you'll probably like Columbus. Fuck all the haters here. It's an incredible movie. Same vein as Lost in Translation.
Those aren't ***Asian American*** movies though. At best they just have Asian American characters like Steven Yuen in Okja. 
Oh definitely - plenty of those (*A Bittersweet Life*, *Memories of Murder*, anything by Kurosawa or Wong Kar-wai) that fits the bill. But in the English language industry I do feel like Asian American actors/directors often get the short end of the stick in terms of opportunities.

Edit: just to clarify doesn't mean English language = better, but some very talented Asian artists are just more comfortabl with/would only excel in playing or working in English language productions (i.e. Steven Yeun is a real talent, but I don't think he'd excel in Korea because his Korean is not extremely fluent/he's used to acting in his own language, they even lampshade this in *Okja*).
WHOOOSH!!!!

That was the sound of point flying over your head.
Only BLT which I quite liked (where is Jason Tobin? He was aces in that).

The japanese are basically what the Germans were to Jewish people. Raped and murdered entire families and villages during the war and left a huge amount of ire between the ethnicities. 
Would love a Han standalone series. It could even take place before he dies, maybe his adventures in Tokyo. Tokyo Drift is one of my favorite FFs. 
Fast and furious hit the Asian note perfectly. Granted Gal Gadot is Israeli but who the fuck care, she's hot and the asian guy get her. So rare a thing where the Asian guy get the girl.

Wait.. I may have found out why fast and furious do well in Asian market... 
Great point. What other films focused on Singapore have ever come across r/videos?

Never ever ever
i think they'll probably address it though. the main character and outsider to the community is presumably a middle class asian-american, so i'm sure they'll make the audience aware that there is more complexity to it.

Can't tell if you're making a joke that's going over my head or if you're replying to the wrong comment.
Fair point, but it didn't start out that way, it was more focused on Eddie. 

If feel Constance has become the Urkel of the show, she took it over. 
Well the show is based on Eddie's life...well, loosely based, especially after the first few episodes. I think the kid that plays Eddie is the weakest actor though so it makes sense they've branched out.
Or the hotel! 
CanCan

FTFY
Meh?
Tan Kheng Hua is in this. CONFIRM CAN.
she also spoke english, which really broke my immersion
The best one is probably GI Joe retaliation.
It's insulting Hollywood execs keep giving these people projects when many talented and sophisticated filmmakers get ignored.
This. My concern with the movie is that it looks like it's going to project Western ideas of Asian representation onto a real Asian setting, and I'm hoping that the average viewer will be critical and inquisitive enough to figure that out.
Like Annihilation and women? (but hopefully successful) Yeah, that'd be a good place to be.

At the moment a palette swap seems to be a decent way to force an ability showcase for other roles that are never even attempted, e.g. sexual Asian male love interest.
FYI it's actually Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen. 
> as I briefly discussed in this comment.

I thought for sure it was going to be "Shawn of the Dead". 
Hope you’re not counting Matthew Damoñ. 
*Big Sick* is an amazing film. First romantic comedy I've seen in a while that i didn't have to rationalize to myself for liking it.
That ending hit me like a ton of bricks. 
American Honey is the most accurate representation of America I have ever seen in a movie, and it was made by a British director!

I feel like foreigners shouldn't be allowed to see that movie, it gives away all our American secrets.
>  It is increasingly annoying for me to watch movies where a protagonist will identify themselves as "just a normal guy!

The solution would be to feature them living a life an average person can afford. 
Yeah it was pretty and John Cho looked fuckin' good, but I ended up just letting it play in the background while reading.
Whelp, maybe not then. That's why it's been stuck on my watchlist.... from the trailer, it looked pretty dull. 
Agreed, so dull
if anyone thinks hollywood doesnt shun asian men, look at what happened to steven yuen. he is literally the best version of an asian american male to ever grace hollywood and he cant even get a role where people know he's asian.

edit: look at almost all his roles after walking dead. it's all voice overs. have any of you ever seen him in interviews? the guy is seriously funny and has a fuck ton of charisma. 
Yeah no for some reason my brain skim-read "American"
Steven Yeun will appear in Lee Chang-dong´s new movie Burning, which is based on a Haruki Murakami short story. 
Memories of Murder was fantastic, also saw The Chaser, I Saw the Devil and a few others that were so awesome but I've never seen A Bittersweet Life, gonna have to check that one out.
On the plus side, asian american directors have some solid gigs lately. The acting parts are hard to come by unless you're part of a handful of pre approved asian americans or hapa.
korean cinema just blows me away
Yeah I misread your post and missed where you specified "Asian **American**" 
But that doesn't explain the "of course he's Japanese" attitude.
i just want him back, i don't care what convoluted bullshit they did to get him back han seoul-o [his original name before it got changed] is the coolest character since han solo

i want gisele [gal gadot] back too but she's probably super expensive now
I wonder if you know, how they live in Tok-ee-o

It was because the show is based off of the real Eddie won't life. The memoir is also named fresh off the boat. But because the show wouldn't touch the real Eddie won't life and Eddie's actor wasn't nearly as strong as constance, they shifted the focus to the parents. So while it started off more "everybody hates Chris" it's become more "modern family"
Yeah it seemed like the accent changed constantly with her. Finishing the trailer and thinking back I wasn’t sure if it was one character or not.
That movie didn't have a plot though... Just a bunch of action scenes.
I prefer Step Up 2 the Streets
A crappy director with a safe project beats out a visionary director with something that might not sell. It's easier to control someone who knows they aren't shit  than someone with a real ego.
Its about revenue. Art doesn't finance a business products do which is how those execs view those projects.
I think they mean the Bollywood style adaptation of Pride and Prejudice called [Bride and Prejudice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_and_Prejudice)
They weren't gay. Clearly bisexual.
i lol'd
That is a great movie, got me really interested in the true stories behind the mag crews.
I think my favorite part was when everyone was emotionally distant and didn't emote.
I saw an interview with him on a David Chang show where he was talking about how big of a fucking deal it was for everyone he knew that he was an Asian man having sex with a white woman on television. The fucking shun is REAL.

Also Chloe Bennet only started getting roles after she changed her name from Chloe Wang.

It's a crying shame to think how much talent is out there being squandered because of prejudice over incredibly minor things.
look what happened when everyone rose a stink about replacing Mulan’s love interest with a white man- rather than cast an asian romantic lead, they dropped the part completely. 
Don't worry. Most of America does too.
Outside if Hiro Murai and James Wan, I'm drawing a blank. 
*Steel Rain* is the Tom Clancy movie I never knew I wanted.
Train to Busan was an excellent zombie movie, imo. 
To clarify, I don't assume, and neither should anyone, that all Japanese people are one thing. Like any group of people, there are good and decent people as well as the bad.

HOWEVER, You gotta admit that Japan is hella strange. You're dealing with a culture that is so emotionally oppressed that the country suffers from a young generation not interested in sex with one of the highest suicide rates of any country. There is serious concern for population collapse in 50 years. We're talking about a land of 2D girl dating, cafes where men pay for hand-holding, and vending machines that dish out used schoolgirl panties. You could argue that every culture has its quirks but I think they're toxic symptoms of unresolved history and unchanged habits.

How the salary man apologizes for having a child at an inconvenient time for his company reminds me of the stories of crazy 'honorable' loyalty from soldiers to the emperor in WWII. There's one story where the mom killed her children so the husband could focus more on the war's efforts.

Due to the swift ending the atomic bombs brought, Japan was never really forced to come to terms of what they did. And the current right-wing government downplays the war crimes in shameful ways. They deny the people's ability to learn and grow and become better for it. Instead, many for generations have been stuck in this identity crisis.

Japan was also the first Asian country to westernize. They historically adopt being 'white' the fastest you could say, but thats a super simplification. It was probably a good move to do so since other countries were being colonized. But it in turn gave them a sense of pride of 'perfection' that they felt had to be spread everywhere. Kind of like the White American's Manifest Destiny.

So maybe that's why my friend and I had the whole "of course" look. Then again, we just know weird Japanese guys.

EDIT: Japan does not have THE highest. One of the highest suicide rates.
The only good thing about Han's death is that it led to one of my favorite bits in the HDTGM Fast 7 episode, which is them riffing on Vin Diesel going to Tokyo and telling Han's family he's taking the body with him back to the States so Han can be with his real family. 
Exactly.
Still don't know why they killed off Channing Tatum in the beginning
His sequels didn't even do well in the states. Now You See Me 2 made about half of the first Now You See Me.
Listened to the Bobby Lee podcast and he told a story of going to read for part and running into Stephen Yuen. He thought it was bullshit Steven still had to read for casting directors. 
Damn. i didn't even know till this comment that she was someone of asian heritage.
oh did they? that's fucking hilarious. it's like the only disney princess with no love interest.
Justin Lin! 
Cary Fukunaga. On top of his well-recieved indie films, he also has all of Season 1 of True Detective on his resume.
Japan is not the country with the highest suicide rate in the world. The suicide rate in South Korea is actually higher.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate
If the revolutionaries before the Meiji era saw the current state japan is , they would be very angry at the amount of effort wasted to get their people to progress, only to see them stagnant.
He got popular AFTER they shot the movie.  They even did extra scenes for him after the movie wrapped after they found out everyone liked him.
She kinda looked halfsie.

But clearly, no one wants a halfsie that *sounds* Asian. 

Kristen Kreuk, Jennifer Tilly, and Pom Klemtentieff are further examples of this. 
Because Asian males can't be legitimate love interests.

I guess Disney doesn't always deny its rich history.
