If he dies, he dies.... too.
The real question is whether MBJ can beat Stallone's "We can all change!" speech from Rocky IV. 
IS THIS YOUR DRAGO?!?!?!?!
That was a great trailer. The Drago shot was wicked 
If they go into Tessas characters hearing loss more I might cry
Oh man. There is not Rocky in the shot which Adonis and his team are walking to the ring. They will kill him won't they? Fuck
Looks awesome.

I'm hoping they don't go full blown villain with Drago.  Have him be somebody that just wants to win, he doesn't take cheap shots, he wins by pure skill.
Withholding the full penetration from the first trailer, smart move.
BRB, hitting the gym. 
Really liked the "you don't think I can beat him" line... callback to Rocky saying the same thing to his manager in Rocky III.
Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) killed Apollo Creed and is now back with his son to fight Creed Jr. Will definitely give this a shot.
Apollo and Drago’s kids both becoming boxers and having a rivalry is a plotline straight from an anime.
God, DNA was the perfect hype song to cut into this trailer. Whoever's playing Drago's son sure does fit the part, [in awe at the size of this lad](https://i.imgur.com/pUhwAs3.png) especially considering MBJ is ~6 foot tall.

edit: The actor is Florian Munteanu who weighs in at 235lb at 6'4".
I'm so hyped for this one. The first one was magnificent and MBJ is a remarkable actor. I rarely go to the cinema but I might go for this one!
Him fighting in the water is my new favorite ridiculous training exercise 
Kinda seems like its hitting on some of the same plot points as the original Creed... but I'm on board. Wish Coogler was directing again.  Not too familiar with Steven Caple Jr.
Tessa Thompson is in this so I’m in.

Bring on the training montage!
Kendrick with Michael B Jordan, recipe for a good time 
A lot of graveyard scenes. Rocky visiting Adrian's and Creed visiting his father's.
You know what would've been interesting? If Drago's son was the hungry underdog, the son of the man who lost everything and took his family down with him. I doubt the old USSR would've had much of a safety net for losers. 
I don't want this movie to exist because if they kill Rocky I won't be able to handle it.
God I hope Rocky makes it through this one too...
Reaction to typical trailer that shows too much:
WTF!?! why are they showing the whole movie?”

Reaction to this trailer:
WTF SHOW ME DRAGO GODDAMNIIIIIIIIT!


Can we get a hologram of James Brown? 
Not sure, how this one will fare after the first Creed. Huge part of it's success was how unexpectedly great it was.
The bad guy is played by Chadwick Boseman, right? Right?
This looks great. I had a feeling Steven Caple Jr. was gonna come through. 
Ivan Drago had a son for the sole purpose to train him to become a great fighter so that if there was even an heir to Apollo Creed, Drago's son could kill them in the ring, because Ivan STILL isn't over Apollo having James Fucking Brown dance all over the place before their fight.  
Curious to see of Dolph will be in this film. Be cool to see a cameo appearance. 
Can I point out how beautiful this trailer is?

Like there's real real art in this trailer of a sequel of a spin off of a movie series about boxing.

It's a really good looking trailer just on its own artistic merits.
Whoever cut this trailer deserves an Oscar. Or a nice pat on the back.
Remember when Rocky and Apollo were enemies but became friends? How much of an upset would it be if Adonis and Drago Jr. become friends after the fight?
That was a very good trailer. Waiting till the last shot to reveal the antagonist. 
Damn... Mama Huxtable looks FINE for being 70.
WOW absolutely great trailer. Cutting it with DNA was a good fucking choice. 

That said, I should watch Creed before seeing this.
Last 10 seconds of the trailer for me..   

"There's the opponent. He's wearing red. Like Ivan Dr..... 

HOLY. FUCK."
The first one was really good, I don't know how much we need another one... but let's face it - MBJ is no less than a GOD so I'm all in! 
I'm still salty Stallone didn't win the Oscar for Creed. It felt like it was his year. Stoopid Mark Rylance.
Hoho Dolph Lundgren is in the cast ,i'm looking for the confrontation with Rocky 
That’s a sick tease for a villain. The family feud aspect in this is such a good direction for the movie. 
We better get a Hearts on Fire Pt. 2
Did you think you were fatigued with another boxing movie?  Incapable of getting HYPE over a trailer?
 
KENDRICK LAMAR SAYS THINK AGAIN MUTHER FUCKER 
This trailer was great! Loved the "Drago" reveal
This might be the most well done, chill-inducing trailer I’ve ever seen.
Hey, I'm in this movie!

Granted, I was an extra that happened to be at Joshua v Parker, where they got crowd shots, but still...
Spent the whole trailer like "okay who's he fighting who's he fighting who's he fighting!?!?!" As soon as he turned and showed Drago's name I fucking yelled! Cannot wait to watch this with my dad like we watched all the Rockys
Fighting Drogo's son?
This looks nothing like part of the Assassin’s Creed universe but looking forward to the reveal!
I just want to see a cool training montage so we can see more Family Guy parodies later.

If you dont get chills when drago turns around and you see his name then i feel bad for you. Lets gooooo!
I thought Creed 2 was Alter Bridge...
That shot of Creed underwater was so awesome
Ippo having retired, this is the closest to a great boxing storyline I can follow
I am so pumped. 
Releasing it on thanksgiving just like Rocky IV, well done.  
Where is Dolph!
My moms an extra in this movie!
***Life's not about how hard of a hit you can give... it's about how many you can take, and still keep moving forward.***
Awesome, I still think we need more villians like him. Although, didn't he die fighting Panther? How is he alive?
The trailer seems to parallel the tone of Rocky 2 like Creed paralleled Rocky, but I have to believe the film will go for more of the action movie feel of Rocky 3 and Rocky 4.
Here I am thinking they’re making a second assassins creed...
What a trailer that didn't completely ruin what the villain is going to be like (other than knowing he is the son of Ivan Drago)??? I'm flabbergasted and very much excited. 

Also the Ali shot of his boxing underwater? Amazing. 
I hope that Creed III will show Creed preventing WWIII by fighting a North Korean steroid monster. 
I was a bit worried given how decreased of a presence Coogler has as well as the whole "fight the son of your dad's killer" plot, but this trailer is hype and the cast remains superb. 
I haven’t been this excited for a movie in a long time! 

Stallone is going to get that Oscar this time for sure. 
I *literally* just rewatched the first Rocky movie. I had no idea this trailer was going to drop. 

Now I’m just hyped all over again. LETS GO DUUUUUDE.
Where is Ivan Drago in the trailer? Figured we would of seen him at least once.
There better be a muscled up Russian woman with a Guile flat top in this. 
If this was the tag line I wouldn't even be mad
“The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows” 
"If i can change, 

and you can change, 

**EVERYBODY CAN CHANGE**"
the speech that ended the Cold War. Maybe MBJ will end election collusion with this one! 
Spoiler alert: nope. 
BURN IT ALL
No.... I’m your Drago!!!
How to train your Drago 
Not saying his name the whole trailer and then having him turn so we see it across his back. Fucking amazing. 
Was hoping for a shot of Dolph somewhere, but that was the next best thing for me.
All I needed to see.

So hyped for this movie.
"I must break you"
Surprised they didn't show if he could run on all fours like a hound and sniff crime like his father.
I completely forgot he was the opponent in this one. Great reveal.
Even when I knew I'd see Drago's name at some point, I still blew everyone's eardrums when I did. 
There are a lot of avenues that this could go down in feely ways. 

There's them learning to sign together. 

Her hearing loss affecting her enjoyment of music. 

And him having difficulty signing do to his hands hurting after a fight. 
This feels like the kind of plot point from the first film that a lesser director would forget about or not carry over into the sequel and that would be a huge drag. Hopefully this isn't the case. 
If Tessa’s character has become 1-layered and her only job is to support and worry I might cry
Thanks for reminding me about that. :(

Still hyped for this movie though!
Sad to say I didn’t know who Tessa Thompson was until Creed. She plays such an interesting character as does MBJ, hopefully they will develop their relationship more. 
No, they won’t kill him.  Most likely Rocky doesn’t agree to be in Adonis’ corner for at least one of the fights.  
That also could be a first match (without Rocky) he loses, thus the hospital scene. Then Rocky trains him for the second match, a la Rocky 3. Not having Rocky coaching in one corner facing Ivan Drago in the other corner? hmm.

But then Rocky may also die during the first losing fight... heart attack during a feud on the ring and now you have Adonis wanting to avenge 2 deaths, biological father and father figure. Bring the cheese 😆 
I was thinking the same thing in the shot :(
They were filming with a closed set at temple hospital in philly awhile back. I was working near there that day. All I thought is "they are filming Rocky's death scene"
Rocky is gonna die. In the picture for the trailer you see Tony's son who rejected training him in 1. At some point Creed will win a belt bc you see him carrying it. Creed will probably get his ass kicked in the first fight. While he's training you see a bunch of press in the background which Rocky also did in 3. Creed goes to LA and trains with him. He even swims, which Apollo makes Rocky do in 3.
Have him be pissed his management is forcing to take this fight. “Creed? I don’t want to fight Creed! My father killed him? My asshole father killed his dad! That’s so awkward! He’s probably going to try to kill me! Let’s not do this!”
> 
> I'm hoping they don't go full blown villain with Drago. Have him be somebody that just wants to win, he doesn't take cheap shots, he wins by pure skill.

Drago was all about that Soviet ultimate athlete training complete with the nastiest of steroids. There was never any "pure skill" with Drago- it was always about geopolitical grandstanding through international athletic events.
[deleted]
That's what I was thinking, IMO the one who's got something to loose is Drago jr, unless there's something on the plot that change that; if he looses, he kills his father legacy and his career, all the motivation is for Creed to avenge his father and not a big enough motivation for Drago jr

but all that is just based on a trailer
He smells crime!
You joke but Creed had some quality gym music. If I Fight, You Fight is a regular on my running playlist. So happy for the composer, I knew him from Community and his works as excellent so it was nice seeing him work on Creed and then Black Panther, where he excelled again.
"It's not that I don't think you can beat him, it's that I've seen how this plays out and I know I ain't making it to Creed III."
Honestly in writing the plot seems ludicrous and is seems to play on my nostalgia for the original rocky movies but seeing the trailer made me feel more excited about this than I thought.  
It's his son fighting Creed. 
It's sad that it's so obvious that Drago will kill Creed Jr, then Rocky, then join the Avengers as the new Hulk.

Way to put the plot in the trailer.
Ddo we know how Drago feels. Its entirely possible hes sorry now
"What happened to Wallace, String?" 
I mean, it happens in real life too. Manufactured rivalries, typically, but they do exist.
I hope in Creed 3 he has to fight his dad
Jesus, do weight classes exist in the Rocky universe?
Ivan Drago confirmed? Hard to see in the still but in that shot in the trailer I'm 90% sure that's Dolph Lungren standing directly behind young Drago. 
Absolute Unit.
NO FREAKING WAY he only weights 235 during the time of shooting, that guy looks much closer to at least 250. 

Edit: grammar 
So instead of fighting the commies, he is fighting the Putinite boxer? 

Pay back for election interference motherfucker! 
Wait... how would they be in the same weight class?
Saw Florian in person while I was an extra, he’s fucking giant
I haven't actually seen any movies in the Rocky franchise. I'm kind of looking forward to doing a marathon of all of them before this comes out. 
I think it's inspired by that infamous photoshoot of Muhammad Ali training underwater.
UFC GOAT Georges St-Pierre trains underwater for real. So...
How is it ridiculous? It's a very accessible and effective training exercise. We used pools for arm strength in tennis too, just didn't have to full submerge ourselves.
Next movie he needs to step it up and train in jello
It's not ridiculous it's actually easier on the joints. 
No one is, but he was picked by Coogler, MBJ, and Stallone to do it. I trust those three. 
Every Rocky movie hits the same plot points, and I literally will never care.
This is gonna be Rocky III. 

Creed loses the first match - hence being knocked out and in the hospital - comes back, trains hard and beats him in the end. Guaranteed Rocky doesn't train him for the first match. 
Coogler also wrote the screenplay for Creed.
Caple Jr actually went to film school with Coogler and are great friends.  He trusted Caple with the film.  Coogler is still executive director on Creed 2.   
Caple Jr is actually close with Coogler IRL and was picked by Ryan to direct the movie in his absence. 

If Ryan trusts him with a franchise he truly does love, then that’s good enough for me. 
Tessa Thompson, Krysten Ritter, and Kristen Bell, those former Veronica Mars females have certainly had some decent careers after the show.
Maybe he’ll drop some songs for the soundtrack like meek, future, and others did for Creed. 
I’ve been bracing myself since Creed ended. And I still don’t think I’m ready.

Sly made a lot of reminiscing posts on Instagram while filming, I really really think this is the end of the road for him. I’m going to be a mess.
He doesn't appear to be in the crowd in [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/DIYDbF9.png), which is a definitely a bit worrisome because everyone else is there, even Ivan. 
I can see him dying in Creed III, kind of how Micky went in Rocky III. 

Also...can we get a Micky prequel?? Edward Norton anyone?
Theres a difference between seeing a character they haven't even tried to say isnt in the movie, and showing the plot beat by beat
Have Childish Gambino do "This is America"
Let’s just get one of his sons. 
So.... Exactly like Rocky then?  It did win best picture....
James Brown is decadent capitalist.
Oh he’s in it. He’s his sons trainer. Top 6 billed actor 
She looks great because she finally dumped Cliff Huxtable....
That scene where both fighters are throwing literal haymakers for like 20 seconds. HOLY FUCK!

I can't wait for the second film.

**edit:** [said scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTtKUvmtFO8&t=2m33s)
You should be glad they are not planning a cinematic universe
> I don't know how much we need another one...

Well, you know, it's a franchise. More than likely there will be another 2/3 films in the future. 
I think everyone, including Rylance, was rooting for Stallone.
Drogo's son died an infant in season 1.
You mangled the quote but I'll upvote anyway because it's so good
You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!
Pls no. I don't want to bring my jizz rag to the cinema again.
"Yo."
"Its a mean and nasty place"
"You're the best thing in my life.But until you start believing in yourself,ya ain't gonna have a life."
"Hey auntie"
*and yous can change 
"In here, there were two guys, killin' each other. But I guess it's better than 20 million..." 

And then he had brain damage. Fuck Rocky V.
"...I've seen a lot of people hatin on me and I didn't know what to feel about that...so I guess I just went on hatin' right back...

During this fight, tho' I seen a lot of changing.  The way y'all felt about me and the way I felt about you.  We in here, two guys
killin each other, but I guess that's better...than our leaders colludin' together.

What I'm tryin' to say is if I can change an' you can change
our leaders should change!

I just wanna...wanna give a shout out to my boy who better have his ass in bed sleep!  Merry Christmas!  Love you!
That reveal sold it for me. Even before that shot, I was hooked, but the way they put that in was slick AF. 
I'm sitting here the whole time like, "Well who the fuck is he fighting?" and it never even occurred to me what they might be doing.  That reveal was a gut punch of awesome. 
Audibly gasped out loud. Fantastic reveal.
[Frame at 1:08](https://youtu.be/cPNVNqn4T9I?t=1m8s) kinda reminded me of the Motherland, and then letters on Russian gave it away completely. Hyped.
I kept thinking, "This opponent better be some next level badass for this to pay off."

It paid off. 
I hadn't heard who he was going to be fighting. I half expected Clubber Lang jr, but when I saw Drago my jaw dropped.
There's a glimpse of russian text on the floor as MBJ is walking out like 5 seconds before that. I was wondering if I was imagining things then the turn sold it. Nicely done. 
Yep never watched a single Rocky movie but somehow that shot was able to give me goosebumps.
I’m kind of upset I looked it up months ago now lol. 
Saving it for the next trailer. And for the movie I hope they save a Carl Weathers ghost appearance
He's right there behind his son at the official weigh ins shot. At 1:34
"Creed, he's a good boy. Big Drama show. I must break him"
"Go for it."
Please not option three 
I think the parallel is they both have a limited window that they can pursue their passion
She is loosing her hearing...


He is loosing his voice due to repeated injuries...



Can love survive in silence?
That's my worry as well. It was such a small (compared to the main plot), yet interesting situation in the first movie that could be carried through multiple films and really create some special moments. 

She is wearing the hearing aid in the trailer so luckily they didn't completely forget about it. 
They better not go full SNL: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAGyyZk6GEY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAGyyZk6GEY)
Yeah I am guessing he won't be there for the first fight (assuming they fight twice). The weigh in scene it doesn't look like Rocky is on stage with him, but if you look carefully Dolph is standing behind the younger Drago
And that's where dads trainers son steps in?
It'd be a nice twist if he was the one looking for redemption and forgiveness for his father's actions, while the media and his management both try to play up the vengeance angle around him to hype up the fight.
I'd love to see some Cobra Kai type of reversing roles and giving a nuanced good/bad to the characters instead of the 80s style fully good and fully bad. Maybe Creed gets so caught up with his own hype and fame he becomes kind of a smug asshole, maybe Drago is a really nice dude and hates his Dad and what he did to Apollo and wants redemption and to be seen as "good."

PS - if anyone here hasn't watched the new Cobra Kai show, the Karate Kid sequel series, go watch it! It's great! *Way* better than expected. 
I think he's referring to what he hopes with the younger Drago in Creed II, not Ivan in Rocky IV.  
I'm predicting that Drago (the Senior) is contrite and has felt like shit for years knowing that he made some little boy an orphan.

Like Max Baer who was the villain in Cinderella Man and was known for killing a man in the ring - in real life he felt horrible and took care of the dead boxer's kids financially, even paying for their college educations.
he nose the truth
Lord Knows/Fighting Stronger pumps me up like nothing else
You mean Ludwig? damn he's all over the place right now. I remember him from Community and a producer for Gambino.


If I Fight, You Fight is also great for drop sets
*I seen

This is Rocky Balboa here, he don't go speakin' so good, you know? 
Yeah does feel like it could've been playing for nostalgia only, but when watching the trailer you feel like this could be a real motivation for the character. Obviously saying that having not seen the film. 
As long as we get some MBJ acting and sweet boxing fights, that's all anyone really wants 
>with his son to fight Creed Jr.
Until they announced his son was fighting Creed I assumed his involvement would be akin to Apollo's role in Rocky III - Rocky is too sick/dead to train Adonis, so Drago steps in to try to atone for killing Apollo.

Having Creed Jr vs Drago Jr be the main conflict sounds a little rote. Hoping they make it work.
Like Leila Ali and Jacqui Frazier.
The heavyweight class doesn’t have a limit, it’s simply anything over 200 lbs (~90 kg). Although usually boxers will agree on a weight limit to fight on an equal footing.

I’m assuming Rocky never told Creed Jr. about this.
The movie where the slow Italian beats his meat and eventually ends the cold war by punching? I don't know that they went for realism. 
That's nothing compared to Rocky IV

[Anyone telling me this was fair is insane](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a7/bd/e1/a7bde164a364299353b38c7ae70786b1.jpg)

Also in the original rocky movies 90 percent of Rockys game plan was to let the other guy hit him so much that he would tire himself out, never realized it as a kid but that's probably one of  the most ridiculous plot holes in all of film.

*edit: Yes rope-a-dope is a legitimate strategy but you're not suppose to let your opponent get head shots and bone breaking hits in. Re-watch the original Rocky fight scenes and you'll see he gets to many punches to the head because he doesn't keep his hands up ([mainly the 3rd fight against Clubber when Rocky forgos Apollos advice to move his feet a lot and allows Clubber to just manhandle his face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4VyvcySBuE&t=2m38s)) 
>Jesus, do weight classes exist in the Rocky universe?

[Remember Valuev from this universe?](https://i.imgur.com/wqyJOQY.jpg)
I mean MBJ has gotten massive since the 1st Creed, so at least giving him a bigger opponent means they have an explanation for why the Adonis character is suddenly swole as fuck.
In boxing, heavyweights is everyone above 90kgs, man. That allows for some seriously lopsided shit
I think that might actually be a plot point for the film since in the last one he fought at light heavyweight. In real life, there are plenty of men who were Michael B Jordan size who moved up to heavyweight to do well or even win championships: Joe Frazier, Rocky Marciano, Evander Holyfield, Roy Jones Jr. (it was a one-off circus type fight though), Ezzard Charles etc. Even the boxer/actor Tony Bellew, who was in the 1st Creed movie as Ricky Conlan, moved up to heavyweight and won a pair of fights.
Yes Lungren is coming back!  This was confirmed a while ago, but it's easy to miss.  It's what has me so hyped for this movie, that and there isn't a Rocky movie I don't love.
[deleted]
Yep - I was in the crowd for some of the fight scenes. Drago is as intimidating as ever. He was even doing pushups in between takes.
Yea, the stats I looked at had him in the range of 235-245 so he was probably at his heaviest during filming while still being a solid boxer.
They're both in the Heavyweight class.  I believe you just need to be over like 200lbs.  Usually people will still agree on a weight though. 
You can skip rocky V. Other than that, enjoy!
They are all quality or at least good fun except for 5. Just skip that and go straight onto Rocky Balboa
start with Raging Bull
For those who don't know, it was from a time when Ali (at the time still Cassius Clay) was still an up-and-coming professional best known from his Olympic victory. Upon finding out that the photographer assigned to him specialized in underwater photography, Ali BS'd something about how he sometimes shadowboxed under water as part of his training. He actually never did that and he didn't even really know how to swim, but the pictures became iconic and helped establish his name and provided him some good publicity early in his career. 
[For the lazy.](https://i.imgur.com/3gYI37j.jpg)
Is it infamous? Why?
Karel Pravec (also known as Silver Fox) has an entire book devoted to this type of training, and he trains at Renzo Gracie's gym along with GSP. 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CITJG9Q/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1
just going to plug everyone to watch GSP's  joe rogan podcast interview and also firas zahabi [GSP and Jon Jones coach] interview with Joe rogan. if you like philosophy, martial arts and a ton of existential stuff combined with fighting you'll fucking love it.

The GSP one actually changed my life, i reevaluated a few things because of that one
Not only the water resistance helps but It also gives you crazy lactic acid tolerance since you are holding your breath
It's the fully submerged part that's ridiculous. Boxing while holding your breath is pointless since boxing is  heavily dependent on having lots of stamina (and oxygen).
[https://i.imgur.com/kEPNkrX.gif](https://i.imgur.com/kEPNkrX.gif)
Do you mean the one where the other boxer is just a physical opponent to compliment the true nemesis of the film, the characters own self-doubt and personal barriers. Regardless of the outcome of the boxing match, true victory is attained by breaking through those barriers and living up to their true potential, regardless of fear and expectation?
They really do, every single one hits the same beats. They're kind of the template for sports dramas at this point.
The one thing ive always liked is he actually does lose sometimes
Imagine the absolute insane reaction if that hospital scene is the last scene of the movie.


My guess is that is another fight. I don't think he will fight Drago twice in the same movie. 
Sylvester Stallone wrote for Creed II though. It looks dope, but I know what OP means by being disappointed that Coogler isn’t *as* involved (he is still producing, though).
Don't forget that Jessica Chastain and Aaron Paul had some of their very first credited roles on that show. 

Max Greenfield and Amanda Seyfried are doing well for themselves too.
Most of those were bangers too
Rocky dying before Adonis’ fight with Drago’s son is exactly how this movie should go. His fight with Drago already has weight behind it, having Rocky gone before it (especially if Rocky doesn’t want him to do it up until he dies) would be some heavy stuff.
Unconsiously, part of it is because Rocky now old enough to die means we're dying too. If Rocky can die and does, it's coming for us too and faster than we ever thought possible.

Also, Rocky is a fictionnal symbol of the ever fighting warrior, kicking life's ass. He embodies the spirit, character and resilience we wish we had. Therefore his death also brings dread feelings about hopelessness and the tragedy of life: no matter how hard you fight, how hard you get hit and keep moving forward, in the end this mean and nasty place kills you and many of your loved one. It's a fight the strongest, real of symbolic, never ever wins.

Acceptance is the key to our mortality and hopefully if Rocky has to go in this movie, he will go inspiring us into acceptance of our own mortality and how life's ultimate hopelessness doesnt steals life of meaning. That's a lot to ask from a movie era that treats all the viewers as having attention deficit, but Stalone doesnt give a fuck and takes the time to give us developed dialogue scenes, so there's hope. 👍


I reckon they fight twice, similar to Rocky III. 

In the trailer, he wakes up beaten up and in hospital. Rocky probably doesn't wanna train him for the first match. You can see Duke's son in that picture - i.e. he goes back to him - and loses.
This looks like MBJ is giving Drago an over-the-pants handjob
Good eye. 
It'll be confirmed at MGM's Hall H panel at Comic-Con this year. The slate was leaked online last week.

Creed I trailer, iirc, showed the entire plot. Glad they toned that down a bit for this one
I loved the one take fight from earlier in the movie, so damn smooth and well done.

https://youtu.be/onY5Daq6jD0
How good Creed fight scenes are make me disappointed how dull Black Panther fight scenes on the other hand
I'm just excited we are revisiting the portions of the Rocky universe where Stalone ended the cold war.
When fight became battle
But I want that Paulie prequel where we find out why his name is Paulie.

"Your names Rocky? Nah that's too hard to remember, I'll call you Rock-o"
Really, if you count it as a Rocky film it’s the eighth film in franchise.

Sorry I meant Ivan Drago.
ITS YOU AGANIST YOU. HE IS JUST IN YOUR WAY.
Damn you went all in on this comment lmaoooo
“Adrian.”
I did this monologue in an intro to acting class in college. The teacher urged everyone to do something from Shakespeare or other classics. But it wasn't about how much he urged, it was about how much I could get urged, and still move forward with doing a monologue from Rocky, and go out and get the B minus I was worth.
And they apparently left Duke in Russia!  And you can somehow go totally broke overnight after winning thcle biggest sporting event in human history.  Where the hell are Rocky's endorsement deals?

Rocky V is best thought of as Rocky's punch drunk fever dream on the flight back from Moscow.
Very well put together trailer, I have a good feeling about this movie 
It almost reminds you of how movie trailers used to be made, hype you up and give a bit of a tease at the end rather than show the whole movie and spoil it like they do these days.
Audibly said *holy shit* out loud. Fantastic reveal. Actually hyped.

I also *literally* just finished rewatching the first Rocky movie like 20 minutes ago. I had no idea this trailer dropped. It was pure coincidence. 
...Or was it?
You honestly should correct that. They're great boxing movies that also are great motivators for life. 
I would recommend them, tbh they are kind of staples of Hollywood for a reason.  I mean Rocky I won 3 Oscars and was nominated for 10.  Its an incredible movie.  Also helps bolster the Creed movies knowing Rocky's past.
At least watch the first one. It'll motivate you into watching the rest of them. Although, in my opinion you can skip number 5 and just go straight to Rocky Balboa and the first Creed movie after 4.
Carl Weathers fades in while MBJ is sitting at a Burger King

Carl: Did you know you can get a refill on any drink you want here, and it's free?

MBJ: It's a wonderful restaurant!

Ron Howard: It suuuure is 
They can use the same one from Happy Gilmore.
"It's all in the hips"
Can you imagine if Drago finds out about the hearing loss and breaks his hands intentionally?
Ah fuck that's good. 
That's my theory too. Rocky won't help Creed in the first fight. He'll be there for the 2nd fight though and go chin to chest with Ivan again.
This would be so good. God damn now I’m going to be pissed when it’s a straightforward good guy bad guy plot.
I'm sure they'll do something like that. Conlan wasn't a bad guy either in Creed
Not fooling me YouTube
Thing about Cobra kai is that the Cobra Kai kid literally TRIED TO RUN DANNY OFF A CLIFF!
"Even now, the Russian government is all about them peds."

I see what you're saying. We'll have to see how it plays out, and I could see a compelling story built on that end where Apollo had to live without his father, but Drago had to grow up with a father ruined by Soviet policies.
Until it just sort of.......ends.
Honestly, it’s a fucking tune. That whole scene where he’s running with the bikes is fucking class 
Last Breath by Future
Don't Waste My Time from Conlan's walkin
You're not wrong though, if the first movie is anything to go by. Creed can be seen as it's own standalone movie with no franchise attachment and it makes complete sense. It's more of a movie that happens to take place in the Rocky universe but the necessary elements that relate directly to the main character are explained.

Nostalgia comes naturally through characters like Rocky appearing and the setting, compare that to something like Rogue One which takes the time to have R2D2 and C3PO pretty much break the 4th wall staring directly at the audience which instantly makes it fail as a standalone movie that takes place within the Star Wars universe. 
That's only because Rocky IV was so ridiculous.

It's a perfectly rationalizable plot though.

1. Ivan Drago was the product of not just a doping, but pseudo-eugenics type of program. Think about how it's rumored China plays "matchmaker" with certain people to produce superior athletes (e.g, Yao Ming). Ivan Drago's wife seemed liked she had pretty good genes in the first film and their relationship might have been arranged on such a pretext. Result: An absolute unit of a lad for a son.

2. Drago's son would use whatever connection he could, exploit it even, to get a matchup against Adonis. Very realistic, assuming the unrealistic back story is taken at face value (his dad killed the other guy's dad in the ring). He has nothing to lose, everything to gain. He makes a name for himself, gets attention, the same way Adonis did in the first film. He pulls himself out of obscurity.

3. Adonis, being as hung up as he is on daddy issues in general, and being the young emotional male he is, would understandably not want to let this go. Ivan Drago robbed him of a relationship with his father. This seems like it will be a major theme because they show his mom accusing him of just using his dad's death as a pretext to mask selfish reasons for fighting Drago (ego). Both are good themes to explore in such a film.

But yeah, the setup totally could work, as preposterous as it sounded on paper.
Like Saddam and Bush then Saddam and little Bush.
Is he moving up to Heavyweight or something? I swear I remember in Creed 1 he fought at Light Heavyweight.
"Slow Italian beats his meat" is a great description for Rocky 
iirc Rocky was heavyweight, so anybody above 200 lbs is fair game as long as they are given the ok from the WBA or whatever.
But man, that fucking montage in the Russian Winter?  That was cinematic gold.
Everyone forgets that a major part of that movie is Rocky’s Italian salami friend dealing with his robot
The cold war was actually ended by the one-two punch of a slow, meat-beating, Italian and a slow, al-queda training, special forces veteran. One changed the ruskies' hearts and minds and the other decimated them on the battlefield. 
To be fair, Rocky having brain damage is a major plot point in Rocky V
>  let the other guy hit him so much that he would tire himself out

The Homer strategy
I mean that's kinda what Muhammad Ali did...
To be fair, it was an unsanctioned fight in Soviet Russia. Rocky was stripped of his belt and lost all of his sponsorships just for participating in the fight. That's why he loses everything in Rocky V. I doubt they followed all of the standard boxing rules.

Edit: Also, the strategy of letting the other fighter punch himself out was primarily only used against Clubber Lang in Rocky III because he was such a big power puncher and had never gone the distance. IIRC Clubber had never gone past the 3rd round.
You wanna see unfair size advantages in the HW division? Look at [Tyson Fury vs Sefer Seferi](https://www.fite.tv/thumbs/v/2o5t6/6/2o5t6_1528491672/funny-tyson-fury-vs-sefer-seferi-wei-1280x720max.jpg) from the other weekend. Shit wasn't even fair.
That's what makes Rocky so awesome though, is his superhuman durability and miraculous comeback powers.
I remember thinking this at the time and that Rocky was like...the worst boxer ever! Never defending and taking hits to the face. Then a friend told me they probably did this on purpose to make the fight more exciting to watch.
My grandfather watch a bit of boxing when I was younger so I knew what to expect in a match. The first time I watched Rocky with my dad I was horrified by his style. I was about 12 and I kept telling my dad “why is he not defending!?”
One of the Rocky movies, either 2 or 5 shows the consequences of that. Rocky's blind in his left eye and also has bright eye shit and headaches. 
Heavyweight is an unlimited weight class and Rocky is supposed to be a heavyweight.

In reality Stallone & Mr. T would probably be light heavyweights with Lundgren and Weathers being more convincing heavyweights.
youre being a little to critical if you ask me. the entire being of rocky revolved around the phrase “its not how hard you can hit, its how hard you can get hit and keep fighting back”
The Juggernaut is real.
The Beast from the East looks like a Punch Out character vs Little Mac.
I am pretty sure the left guy is from a DnD monster manual...
That guy legit looks like a cromag
even Rocky V ? 
What about Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge?
Oh man it would be funny if Rocky ends up nailing him with one good punch at some point in the film.
Notice who ISN'T in that picture though? Rocky...

I'm going to guess that this is a shot from before the first fight, the one that sends Creed to the hospital.

We all know there will be a 2nd fight and in THAT one Rocky will be on the stage to go chin to chin with Ivan.
Wait wasn't Creed a Cruiserweight or Light Heavyweight in the first film?

Did he move up in weight in this one?
Tommy was such a piece of shit, if they went with the original ending for that movie fans would have lost their shit.
Rocky III is my personal favorite for some reason... not the “best” movie but it’s the most “Rocky” Rocky movie lol

I also quote Clubber Lang and Apollo Creed on the reg when I train... “I got a lotta mo’” and “He’s hookin, he’s hookin, DAMN ROCK COME ON!”
Unlike other people, I recommend Rocky V only for the fact that it's an important lesson for Rocky to become a good mentor. It shows him that with bad influences, a young aspiring boxer can be molded to be a horrible person. So when Adonis Creed comes to him to be his coach/mentor, Rocky isn't too keen on doing that again.
I love me some Rocky Balboa (VI).  Nothing gets me hyped more than a Rocky training montage.
You can skip Rocky V, but you'll lose the context of how/why Rocky lost his fortune, and how he ended up where he is by Rocky 6/Creed 1. 
Only part of rocky V worth watching is when rocky goes back to Micky's old gym and reminisces about Mickeys speech. "GET UP YOU SON OF A BITCH!" "Cause Mickey loves ya." A lot of that speech is from Cus D'amato talking about Mike Tyson.
The first half or so of Rocky V is brilliant. A broke and aging Rocky and Adrian move back to the old neighborhood with nothing but their love for each other. Rocky going back to Micky’s gym and the flashback? Gut wrenchingly beautiful. Rocky deciding to be a trainer like his father figure Micky makes perfect sense. But yeah, past that its hard to watch it get progressively worse and worse. 
Ali was all about that PR image. A good story was so much better than a boring training montage of jump rope and punching the same thing over and over again.
Thats actually a very cool story; and very Ali like. 
MBJ's [current profile picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/832679643291512833/q2p9YNOt.jpg) on Twitter is a nice homage to it. Interestingly enough he's had it for quite a while so I guess it was some stealth marketing for Creed 2.

Well restricting your oxygen intake is a good way to make your body more efficient with what it gets. Barometric chambers and training on mountains. Get used to that thinner air and you're a killer at sea level
> Do you mean the one where the other boxer is just a physical opponents to compliment the true nemesis of the film, the characters own self-doubt and personal barriers

That's not true. In 4 the other boxer was communism.
Cue Rocky music!
The REAL treasure is the friends they made along the way
I'm calling it now, Creed loses and gets put into critical condition in Creed 2. Rocky has to the face the fact that he might lose another friend to Drago and Creed has to face the fact that living in his father's shadow is going to kill him.

I have no basis for this, it's just what I imagine a Rocky movie would do at this point in the series.
That would be empire strikes back level
Yes but that sets up Creed 3. Essentially doing what happened with Rocky 1 & 2.

I have no problem with this.
If Creed II ends exactly how Apollo's fight in Rocky IV ends? I'm not sure if theaters would be dead quiet from shock and sorrow, or rioting from outrage 
My guess is that fight is the last of his career, then he realizes Drago's son is fighting and wants to unretire.
> Sylvester Stallone wrote for Creed II

Given the right tools, Sly can write. I mean, Rocky won Best Picture, so I'm not too worried about the story, but yeah, still wished RG was more involved since his direction/story killed it in Creed 
Rocky vs Rambo ends when their actors realise that their mothers have the same name. 
Yeah it’s only a matter of time before we get 3 films per year in the RBU. 
Paulie 2: Paulie fucks the robot
You joke, but I'd probably watch an Apollo origin story.
I don't know how the flying fuck they shot that, but its incredibly impressive.
THE AUDIO IS SO GOOD!!!
In the making of video they talk about how they first made fight scenes live but then made everything CG instead. It was horrible but i no longer blame Coogler for it. Marvel fucked that one up.
What about T’Challa vs M’Baku and T’Challa vs Killmonger round 1? I’m not disagreeing I wish there were more actual fights rather than cgi Iron Man battles in the movie but the ones we got were far from dull. 
The waterfall fights were pretty good.  Not superhero fights, but still good fights.
Complain about the CGI fights all you want. However, the Waterfall fights and Casino fight were great. 
Drago's son is an IRA troll when he's not training
Paulie's Birthday Robot: Origins
Or how many people sacrifice their lives to make the Rocky vs Apollo match happen.
A DOTHRAKI HOARD NED
"You know what I'm saying?"
I did it!
Rocky II + Rocky V = Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge! 
Nice reference within a reference. I see you. That's how winning is done!
As least the professor didn't say to you, "You weren't born with much of a brain, so start usin' your body."
>  And you can somehow go totally broke overnight after winning thcle biggest sporting event in human history. Where the hell are Rocky's endorsement deals?


Thats pretty much status quo with boxers dude.
It's amazing because I wasn't expecting Creed to be that good but I was blown away. The hype is real this time around
I was watching a gob of trailers from 80s and 90s movies, mostly horror but a lot of dramas too. They had huge spoilers in them back then too. Maybe we just didn't have anyone to talk about them with so we didn't care.
Old trailers spoiled way more dude
This mostly applies to comedy. So many movies just aren’t that good so they blow their load and show all the funny parts in the trailers.  Horrors somewhat do this as well but at least some of the time they use scary scenes that don’t appear in the movie at all. That can be disappointing too but I’d rather a big scene get cut than be ruined in a trailer. 
We're all robots except you.
It was...

...OR WAS IT?!?!
Michael B. Jordan puts a steak over his eye after the fight, and goes to throw it away:

Carl Weathers: Woah, hold on there! You take this home, throw it in a pot, add some broth and a potato...baby, you got a stew going!
I just started Arrested Development and now I see references everywhere... It's great. 
Umph, that would be extra shitty
What is I must break you in sign language?
Not sure that's a big risk in boxing.
Oh man Rocky-Drago old man stare down will be fucking epic.
*"I will break you."*
Sets up the heel to face turn where Creed and Drago are allies 
Wasn't he going to jail? Isn't that why they were having the fight vs Creed?
I don't really know about that. Sure Conlan wasn't a Villain per se, but he was a hot-headed asshole.

Rocky Conlan #1(37-0) was supposed to fight Daniel Wheeler #2 (31-0). However Ricky broke Daniel's Jaw at the weigh in, effectively ending Daniel's career. If anything, this guy deserves some sympathy.

Side-note: Daniel is the same guy who laid out Adonis at the beginning of the film, when Adonis was trying to prove a point in Apollo's old gym.
your loss! that shit is fantastic
Rogue One was about the stealing of the Death Star plans, an event that was referenced in Ep IV. We already knew the relevance of the movie to the universe. Going in you knew it was pretty much right before Ep IV. 
Agreed. There's a lot of forced relevancy in the Star Wars Universe at the moment. I actually enjoyed Solo a bit more. Although Han is obviously being forced on the audience, along with Lando and Chewie, the reveal at the end [Darth Maul being the apparent leader of the Crimson Dawn](#spoiler) was pretty entertaining for me. I think what works for the Creed movies is that they are expanding on the Rocky Universe and adding lore to existing characters. Star Wars has struggled with that at times. 
Those were the same Saddams though.
Maybe Tony Bellew has fought at heavy weight, his last two fights but he is a light heavy weight/Cruiser-weight  
[Have I got a treat for you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLgirz6zwMw)
[deleted]
Let's not forget the late, great Butterbean

https://youtu.be/DBwPlXe3p3o

Edit: apparently actually not dead, what a specimen 
MBJ is right around 180-185 though, so we wouldn't be a heavyweight, he would drop to light heavy or be a cruiser. In CREED he was a light heavyweight.
was Rocky IV the only movie that did back-to-back montages with almost no breaks in between. that was so awesome. the entire movie was just montage fight montage montage fight
HEARTS ON FIRE!!! STRONG DESIRE!!! 
Yep. 4 is my favorite by far of all the rocky movies. I'd rate them this way: 4,3,2,Rocky,1
Paulie was definitely fucking that robot. 

The robot was actually a member of the screen actors guild. It's name is Sico. Originally, it was created to help autistic children communicate, which is why Stallone wanted it in the movie.  His son is autistic and loved Sico.

And then he got to see Paulie fuck it.
Yeah and I'm glad they showed him not being all there in the last too movies because it really emphasized the pain he went through in the prior movies. It's so sad seeing him write that workout for Adonis and struggling with spelling simple words like "shadow" :(
Ali was an outboxer, though. He’d let you punch yourself out while dodging, he’d avoid any solid hits. Even while using the rope a dope, he’d lean back to dodge most headshots.

Rocky was more a slugger with bad defense. He’d just let his opponents give him brain damage and wait for his chance to knock them out. Makes for great film, but a fighter who fights like that wouldn’t have a long career.
To a much lesser extent sure. But they were both listed at 6'3 and Foreman is said to have only 4 pounds on Ali at the time. [Best picture I could find for their size difference it's mainly muscle difference.](http://b78b.http.cdn.softlayer.net/00B78B/thesweetscience/images/George-Foreman-Muhammad-Ali-1028.jpg)

In the picture above Drago is like a foot taller than Rocky and probably has a good 80 pounds on the dude. If that there was ever a fight like that in the real world with world champion level boxers the smaller dude would have 0 chance every time.

*edit: Oh you meant the strategy of getting hit a lot. I guess that's true but for that strategy you're not suppose to let your opponent hit you in the face every time like Rocky did. 
Well, no. He lost everything in Rocky V because he gave power of attorney to a lawyer before leaving who tried to invest the vast sums into high risk, high reward accounts to make himself some money on the side and wound up losing it all.
Yeah even Rocky V, it's certainly not my favorite, but I love Stallone in it.  It put Rocky in a different place, making him poor, not being allowed to do what he does best.  It really is a dull movie and boring and his son is all angsty in it which is kind of dumb, but I always loved what Rocky would do to make his son happy.  

It's not the best Rocky film, but I still love it.
Rocky V doesn't exist
It’s not as bad as people say, it’s like the phantom menace I’ll never put it in the dvd but if I come across it on tv , I’ll watch
Paulie's line "I thought I was doin' good business!" has come in handy so many times when playing poker with friends that it's single-handedly justified the existence of Rocky V for me.
What was the original? 
The 30 For 30 on the real guy was pretty heart-breaking to watch. 
I was watching documentary where Stallone say the reason why Rocky V was so shit because it wasn't about boxing and it didn't have ring or matches, that's why fans disliked it. Thats what he said.
THERE IS NO TOMORROW! THERE IS NO TOMORROW. 
Yea III was a fitting conclusion to the Rocky Trilogy.  VI was ok, but honesty looking at it when older eyes it was really terrible.  They should never have killed Apollo, perhaps crippled him for life, but never out right killed him.  V was horrible.  VI is kind of what V should have been like with a much younger Rocky.  Ultimately V and VI really never should have happened and haven't mattered much in the way of Creed.  If they did matter then Rocky would have been concerned Adonis would turn or leave him like Tommy did, but that never really came up.  The same with Adonis seeing Rocky fight in the 'what if' fight in VI.  Other than Adrian and Paulie dying, nothing's really transferred to the Creed movies.  It's fine because it's not Rocky's story anymore, but strange that his son isn't more involved, cause he's still alive.
Rocky III is one of the best action movies.
Fair point. 
Plus you get to see Stallone’s kid act, for what it’s worth. Sad to hear that he passed away fairly recently too.
"Yeah! Let's start building some hurtin' bombs."
RB is my favorite movie of all time, full stop. The only movie where I've ever teared up at the end.
Or doing 10 thousand situps lol
Not THAT stealthy considering they announced this movie a while ago, but I see what you mean haha
It's amazing that they were able to do Ali's photo better, given how long ago it was.
"Great! You've killed the invisible swordsman!"
Yep.  At my boxing gym, a guy used to train with a mask that restricted oxygen.  Helped him build his endurance up during sparring sessions.
Rocky IV: Quest for peace
Communism, Aging, and Grief
For some reason the Guile theme began playing in my head when I read this.
Rocky, realizing that his friend Adonis is dying, decides to avenge his death by fighting Drago himself, setting up a historic battle between a comically giant Russian and a 75 year old man with cancer. "You can't win!" everyone tells him, but deep down, he knows that it's not about winning, but about proving the resilience of the human spirit. 
Especially given that it's in the trailer. nobody would expect that ending, because it's "in the trailer." It's like a double bluff spoiler.
Not trying to be a naysayer, but his last great writing credit was First Blood in 1982. Since then, he's written some real stinkers. I'm cautiously optimistic though.

I'd feel a lot better if Coogler were still around. 
With a hamfisted extended cameo by Judge Dredd who fights with them against a mutated Ivan Drago.
And their fathers. And they both know someone named Paulie.
I also think that Marvel does try to limit that physical violence quite a bit. They're really keeping it "clean" so kids can watch and get pumped in a "pro wrestling brawl!" kind of way.
I enjoy a lot of the Marvel movies, but the overdone CGI for every action sequence always looks really bad to me.
Many promoters died to bring us this match.
You mean when Rocky single-handedly won the Cold War by making Gorbachev embrace Glasnost? Very hard to top. 
Thanks! I had to be willing to take the downvotes, and not pointing fingers saying my karma ain’t where it is because of bots, or trolls, or anybody. 
Good thing. I was so in character I probably would have laid him out. 
Hope so, but it's not Coogler this time at all. It's the guy behind the Netflix Luke Cage show that's ~~directing~~ writing, so he hasn't exactly been tested in the feature film space.
yeah that person has never actually seen trailers from the 90s or 80s
MBJ goes home and accidentally makes hot ham water
That would be Drago
Something inside of me says thats just breaking him
I can't wait!
Then in Creed 3 they'll train together to achieve the Eye of the Tiger and defeat Mr. T once and for all.
“The enemy of my enemy is my friend”
Yeah, for possession of a handgun iirc. Criminal but it's not like he was an abuser or anything
Yes, but Pretty Ricky about to face jail was a plot element needed to make that fight happen, not to establish him as a villain.
That was hilarious, thank you for that.
That was amazing.  

And that muscle suit looks just like Stallone nowadays
Risky click
I meant slow upstairs, not in his boots.
But Butterbean is still alive
That's the dude from Jackass!
> the late, great Butterbean

He's 300 pounds. Of course he's late to everything.
We just had a real Wade Boggs moment everyone. 
The real crime of Rocky V was that it didn’t take it to the logical conclusion, a movie length montage of smaller montages. 

We need a Rocky that’s just montages all the way down. 
I think that's because he's generally always been pretty dumb, though (or rather, not "book-smart"). He's near-illiterate until Adrian starts helping him to read in Rocky II.
>  Makes for great film

I know it has virtually nothing to do with this since it was a light weight fight. 

But if anyone wants to see the only boxing match I've ever seen that legitimately REMINDED me of watching rocky movies - you must see Ward Gatti 

It's just an absolute 2 man war

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-XyRC6JVD8
> Ali was an outboxer, though. He’d let you punch yourself out while dodging, he’d avoid any solid hits.

In the context of Rumble in the Jungle where he most infamously used the rope-a-dope that's not really true though. Ali in his prime fighting the likes of Liston, Patterson, Williams, and Terrell was a quick outboxer that avoided any damage, but by the time his ban was lifted and he returned to the sport he relied a lot on the fact that he could take punches well to beat his opponents.

Against Frazier, Foreman, and Shavers he took hellish punishment as a result.
Yep both men were 6'3, whereas Smoking Joe Frazier was only 5'11. He weighed just about the same as the other two at 203 lbs, Wladimir Klitschko is 6'6 and fought typically at 240 pounds.

 Guess I'm just throwing things out that stuck in my mind, also heavyweight means anyone 200 pounds and up, below that is cruiserweight and 175 down to 168 is considered light heavyweight.

Only champion fight that sticks out in my mind with a pretty big size and weight difference was Roy Jones Jr. at 5'11 and 193 lb vs. John Ruiz at 6'2 and 226 lb., Jones won by unanimous decision. I consider him the best fighter of all time, six time world champion in four different weight classes. Ruiz was no slouch either, his record was 38-4-1 at the time.
I think he's referring to the 'let your opponent punch you until you get tired' part not the size part. 
Bullshit. There are loads of examples of a smaller fighter beating a bigger fighter. David Haye and Nikolai Valuev with Haye winning the title. 

100lbs weight difference and nearly a ft in height difference between the two. 

Even Hulk Hogan beat Andre the Giant, and he was a giant! Amen brother!
Same.  They had some nice ideas there they just stumbled in the execution.

It's the only reason why I don't omit Rocky 5 from the series because it's still a chapter and natural progression of his life that leads right into 6/Rocky Balboa.  Oddly, Rocky 6 is the only Rocky movie where the fight is better than the movie leading up to it.  Every Rocky movie prior (yes even/especially 5), the story leading up to the fight gives it weight and is some of the best parts of the movie.  In 6, I couldn't wait to get to the fight.
Rocky V has a pretty great last 30 minutes. Everything before that is pretty lousy.

EDIT: Though I maintain the scene in the shower dealing with Rocky's brain damage is some of the finest acting Stallone has done. Chilling the first time I saw it.
>Rocky V doesn't exist

*My ring is outside*
Yes it does, its called "Rocky Balboa".
[Rocky was suppose to lose the street ball against Tommy and die in Adrains arms.](#spoiler)
There was an alternate ending where Rocky died as a result of the Rocky/Tommy street fight
Rocky dies.
Apollo was killed in Rocky IV not VI

IV is the best of the series if you're looking for pure 80's cheese fest.

III is good, but it isn't anywhere near as good as I or II 
No air-conditioning was the key
The air that is at higher elevations has less oxygen in it. Those masks  are simply like breathing through a straw. They don't reduce the actual oxygen content in the air.

Higher elevations also have less air pressure, which is completely different than taking in less air. 

Elevation masks do nothing to help your training, and if anything, makes your training worse. 

https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/do-elevation-masks-work.html


Oh that's why they called it that.
which is weird considering the fight scenes in civil war and winter soldier were fantastic and nobody complained about it being too violent
Which is why Winter Soldier still holds up, some of the most brutal and impactful grounded combat scenes 
Yep. Sad but true and it keeps getting worse. It's basically watching a cartoon now. 

Many ~~promoters~~ mafia goons died to bring us this match.
He would have to go over the top.... 
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyWx1CkMTtI) an **excellent** five minute feature on Rocky v The Cold War done for ESPN's 30 for 30
Millennials don't know what you mean.  They were taught that it was Luke Skywalker who won the cold war because of Regan's star wars program.
Circlejerkers do that and that ain't you!, you're better than that!
*omg he just keeps doing it*
It's not the Luke Cage guy directing (Coker). He is one of the writers, which is just as worrisome to me. 

About Steven Caple Jr., the actual director of this, I know absolutely nothing about. 
“I’ll break you”
Then they find out that even Mr T. Was being mind controlled by evil mastermind Michael Buffer, so all three of them go around the world, recruiting fighters from all sports to challenge him. 
Next time on Dragon Ball Creed 
And not Mr. T's son, either. The real Mr. T.
Didn’t he also attack the guy he’s was originally supposed to fight at the weigh in ?
That scared me at first, I was like “when the fuck did he die?”
RIP Wade Boggs
Oh, thank goodness for that
"Is Butterbean okay?"
He's smart enough in the first movie when he's keeping records of the guys he's beating up and reading the ingredients on his turtle food. I think there is a definite decline, although not sure if that's supposed to be a plot point.
Holy crap. Which one of them ended up winning?
i always liked the fight where ward was taking a beating and not doing much, and the commentators are talking shit about him, then he drops that guy with a head/body combo
I don’t know how much of the Frazier and Foreman fights were Ali *planning* on taking a ton of hits and not being unable to stop Frazier and Foreman from advancing in. Frazier’s gazelle punch specifically countered Ali’s range. Foreman was just a monster. Ali didn’t have the strength to jab him back.
I'd say Haye at 6' 3", 217lbs vs Valuev at 7' 0", 316lbs for the WBA heavyweight championship is the biggest difference I can think of. 
Oh my bad. Yeah I guess that's true, but in the Rocky movies Rocky never puts his hands up to guard his face and let's who ever he's fighting fuck him up too much. I guess they just want to emphasis his toughness. Maybe I'm over thinking it. 
I remember when Hogan slammed that dirty stinky Giant in front of 500,000 screaming Hulkamaniacs in the Silverdome in Detroit, Brother!
6 to me feels like they couldn't wait to get to the fight either, still it was nice to see what Rocky had been up to and the fact that he just felt lost.  Pauly was so great in the movie and it had a lot of great scenes as well.  That movie felt like it was all about the fight, which isn't bad because that fight was great.  

For me Rocky is a solid series, the Creed series has done a great job with making this all about Adonis, there is no mention of Rocky's son though which kind of disapointed me, but who cares it's called Creed for a reason.
Touch me and I'll sue
Haha holy fuck. 
Wish they went to the alternative of Paulie's robot laser blasting Tommy's head off
Yeah, people would have rioted
Ok, I don't think it could even be much worse than that. 
Yeah I’m surprised to see III getting so much love. It’s my least favorite of the first 4. The original is the “best movie”, in my opinion. IV is my favorite for exactly the reason you stated - it’s the perfect 80s movie. 

III is just kind of “meh” to me. It’s a good movie but it doesn’t have the quality story telling of the original, and it doesn’t go full on 80s cheese like IV so it’s just kind of stuck in middle. 
Absolutely. I think the first two Captain America movies hold up a lot better in that aspect.
He would have to go commando...
As a millennial, I knew what they meant. Also, Rocky > Star Wars
"*...emotionally*"
I MUST break you*
"I'm Rocky Balboa. I'm here to recruit you for the Testosterone Initiative.
For a minute there, I thought we were in Wade Boggs territory.
Wade Boggs is very much alive! He's 50.
you're just saying he's smart enough to read and write
Ward won fight #one. they went on to have 2 rematches - which are if anything equally as amazing to watch. 

In one of the rematches Gatti breaks his hand punching ward and hitting his hip bone - he goes on to win the fight w/ a broken hand. You can see it in his face every punch he lands until the hand goes completely numb. It's also quite cinematic really.

Neither because brain damage.
If I remember right, Mickey Ward won that fight. They made a movie about it like 7 or 8 years ago.
I remember seeing an interview with Ali that he did initially plan on trying to outbox Foreman, but quickly realized that he 

1. Was going to get caught doing that since Foreman was so great at cutting off the ring 

2. Was going to run out of stamina *fast* trying to dance around the ring thanks to age and Zaire's heat.

So he definitely didn't go into that fight with the intention of taking damage, but I think once he started to adopt the rope-a-dope he probably realized that it was only inevitable that he would have to take some to give some back against Foreman.

I think you're 100% right that he just couldn't stop Frazier from coming in, no matter how hard he tried to create distance.
If you’re watching Rocky for realism you’re gonna have a bad time
There’s a moment in Creed when they’re looking at old photos and Rocky mentions his son moved to another city and has a wife and kid and they’re in touch, but he doesn’t see him that much anymore. FWIW, Milo Ventimiglia has said he’d be willing to reprise his role but they haven’t reached out.
> there is no mention of Rocky's son though which kind of disapointed me

I could have sworn there is a picture of his son that Rocky kind of gives an "I don't want to talk about it" type of response to when Adonis brings it up. But It's been a few years and I've only seen the movie twice so maybe I'm misremembering. 
Nah... Paulie's robot actually comes to box Tommy and knocks him out. Then everyone realizes that robots can box instead, roll credits and then the sequel becomes REAL STEEL!
Apollo becoming a good guy is a major thing in 3
That's quite the cliffhanger
The math checks out.
Opening scene: We stare from behind at Creed's feet, jogging in tempo on the sidewalk to some hip song playing. Camera pans up to the back of his track jacket, the word "Creed" emblazoned proudly in red and white. He's accepted his identity. As the beat amps up, Creed starts throwing punches to match the tempo while still jogging. Local Philly people wave, pat him on the back, a delivery truck is seen dropping off turkeys at a grocery store nearby, it's clear he's going to train. He enters a dilapidated looking building as the song begins to fade out, this must be some sort of gym Balboa practiced at in the day. But he runs up the stairs, past rooms where people are working out and training, but enters a classroom. The song cuts abruptly right when a middle-aged, female teacher says "Adonis! You're late!"

Creed takes an open seat, the class is mostly adults, some wearing visible hearing aids. The teacher speaks again: "Now Adonis, since you finally graced us with your performance, how about you show us how to sign "What is your favorite Thanksgiving dish?" People in the class smile, they like him, he's a local celebrity but a good student and a nice guy. Creed goes to the front of the class, but forgot he still has his tape on his fingers from training earlier. The class has to awkwardly wait as he unwraps them, teacher even humorously offering a pair of scissors. He signs the first few words correctly but his hands struggle with the word "Thanksgiving," he's fingers still injured from training, but also because Thanksgiving has been a somber occasion for him. Teacher cuts him a break and has another student come up.

CUT TO: Philly shopping mall. Rocky is sitting at a booth, offering photos and autographs for $20. It's the only thing he can do now for money. A local dad shows up with his son, saying he really wanted to meet the champ. Rocky says well let's take a picture, dad says they don't have much money this time of year, and Rocky feels bad and offers to give it to him for free. The kid is ecstatic. After his shift, Rocky takes a breather and goes to the mall sport's bar. He sees on ESPN a report about young Drago being undefeated in the European boxing circuit. Bartender comments to Rocky "hey didn't you win against that guy?" Rocky says, "yeah, but I lost EVERYTHING."

Rocky is worried by the new Drago. He goes home and there's a posh sports agent waiting outside his door. "Got a minute rock?" he asks, as Rocky is opening the door up. Rock steps inside, door still open, and shouts to the agent "you're wasting your minute!" Agent wants to know if Creed would fight Drago. Would make them both millionaires, even if he loses. Rocky, taking a look at a foreclosure notice on his table, triumphantly says no. Agent pins his card to Rocky's fridge just in case he changes his mind.
For the Expendables initiative?
Wade Boggs has been dead for years, though. His ghost talks to me when I get drunk on planes.
Wade Boggs would be rolling in his grave if he heard you say that
But in Rocky II he has to read cue cards for a commercial and it comes out that he don’t read so good. The director yelled him off the set with derisive comments about his literacy problems. 
Arturo was supposedly killed by his wife actually.
Ward won this fight but Gatti won the next two fights, they fought 3 fights in a row. The movie was called The Fighter and Marky Mark played Mickey Ward
real talk, real steel was fun even though it was practically Robo-Rocky and I'd have liked a Rocky II comeback movie off that one.
Adonis goes back home to pick up Valkryie for Thanksgiving dinner with Rocky. He walks into their apartment and is sifting through the mail, shouting at Valykrie if she's ready. She doesn't reply, he thinks something might be wrong. He barges into their bedroom and into the bathroom, scaring Valykrie who is getting her makeup ready. She asks when did he get home? It's clear her hearing is getting worse.

During an uber to Rocky's, Adonis is facetiming his ma at home in California wishing her a happy thanksgiving. She wanted to come but was too sick to travel, with a hearty cough heard on her end of the call. The cough worries Adonis. They arrive at Rocky's and have a nice time, there's some other people there from Valykrie's music scene, Rocky's old training bros, and a few of Adonis' new friends. The group seems awkward at first but Adonis says he knows what will unify everyone. He puts on Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give it Up" and everyone except Rock starts dancing. They all encourage Rock and he finally gets up, ,showing off amazing moves. They're all laughing and having a blast, it's the best Thanksgiving for everyone in a while.

Adonis and Valykrie offer to clean up as the crowd goes home. While asking Rocky where the paper towels are, Rocky says their in the second cupboard. Adonis opens them and finds the foreclosure letter, along with the agent's letter and card. He yells at Rocky, prompting their argument outside we see in the trailer. Rocky says "this guy is a beast, you have no idea."

Cut to Russia. We see dogs in cages, barking at something malevolent. We follow the footsteps similar to Adonis at the opening scene, and it's Drago. He's a bulky guy, and when he finally turns around, we see a nametag on his sweater that says " доброволец", aka VOLUNTEER. He's working at an animal shelter because he has a good heart. There are scenes of him picking up dog poop, playing fetch with the mutts, and trying to persuade a Russian family to adopt a pit bull that seems savage but is kind of a sweetheart. They decline. Drago then goes home to his monster mansion in Moscow, where some of his dad's old boxing pals are there. They tell him they want him to fight Creed to reclaim Russia's glory. Drago says the only glory he cares about is the one he shares with man's best friend. Russian government guy slaps him and says "this can all be taken away" and walks out.  

yeah and he just kept a list about who to beat up in Rocky I i don't know where this idea that he was a wordsmith before he fought Creed is coming from
She was arrested for homicide but then an autopsy ruled it a suicide according to wiki.

Also, the Gatti-Ward fights were not in the movie.  They were supposed to be featured in a sequel, which never ended up getting made.
