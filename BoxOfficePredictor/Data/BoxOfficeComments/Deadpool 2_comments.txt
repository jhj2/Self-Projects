Wonder how his wife Blake Lively felt about the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants reference 
It's great to see that Dopinder is back.
Love the fact he's spinning in Professor X's chair, looks like this time they were able to afford the set.
Hiring a john wick director shows. the action looks pretty great.
Isn’t that Bill Skarsgård behind Domino on the plane when she’s talking about the X-Force at 1:40???
John Wick style action scenes with a unkillable mutant.

Nice. 
I'm still hoping for a 'Hugh Jackman as Hugh Jackman and not Wolverine' cameo. 
Fucking hell, that handgun to the hand back to the head was nuts
I noticed the unmistakable large head of noted virgin Rob Delaney.
Is that the kid from Hunt for the Wilderpeople?

Also yes Terry Crews!
Holy shit Terry Crews is in this?! 
Man, Morena Baccarin gets hotter as she gets older.
X-force. Perfect
Was he just fuckin around in Professor X's wheelchair?!
“From the studio that brought you 27 Dresses and The Devil Wears Prada”

It's a Deadpool trailer, alright.
Haha, the Youtube description:

>After surviving a near fatal bovine attack, a disfigured cafeteria chef (Wade Wilson) struggles to fulfill his dream of becoming Mayberry’s hottest bartender while also learning to cope with his lost sense of taste. Searching to regain his spice for life, as well as a flux capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship, and flavor – finding a new taste for adventure and earning the coveted coffee mug title of World’s Best Lover. 
[To be fair they've always kind of acknowledged how derivative they were](https://i.imgur.com/j5jHgiq.jpg)
Ricky Baker! It's your birthday! 
All I want is a Hugh Jackman cameo as himself

^^please
Everyone here talking about the comedy and I’m excited about That fight choreography.

Fucking fantastic 
“It’s hard to hear you with that pity dick in your mouth.”  

Never change, Blind Al!
One can only hope this lives up to the superhero action quality of The Devil Wears Prada and 27 Dresses.
Purple hair says Psylocke. Powerset says Surge. But who knows? I didn't realize NTW was supposed to be NTW until they told us. She could be Cyclops for all we know.


Infinity War, Deadpool 2, and Ant-Man all coming out within a month of each other 

I love it
Oh, hell yes! That Yakuza katana fight sequence looks like it'll be epic. 
Sweet Raiders of the Lost Ark homage at the beginning 
David Leitch definitely brought his style along. ALSO X-FORCE. TERRY CREWS.
Honestly, this looks better than the first one.
wait.. is that Bill Skarsgård from It?? 1:40
"They need to be tough, morally flexible, and young enough to carry their own franchise in 10-12 years"
It's Ricky Baker!!
Man I wish they still called it "untitled deadpool sequel" 
Not sure how this movie will be overall in the comedy department, but the action definitely looks awesome.

The gunshot through the hand switcheroo kill got me pretty good though.
Omg he is in Professor X wheelchair
This humour is so good, praying this lives up to the hype even somewhat because it looks so good! 
Damn! Morena Baccarin is the finest woman on earth.
Can we all take a moment to savour the fact that TERRY FUCKING CREWS is in this movie?!

TERRY LOVES YOGHURT
God... Damn! Morena is a smoke show!
Love it. Its Deadpool alright. Really wish people would stop trying to look at Deadpool like it's going to be some game changing masterpiece. It's a movie about a comic book character that is absurdly violent and full of raunchy childish one liners and foul language.. Never tried to be anything else so stop viewing it as such
I wish they'd dump that low saturation, blue filter. It's so ugly. :(
DID I SEE TERRY CREWS AS A MUTANT.
But how many Justice Leagues will this make?
"Sorry I'm late. I was rounding up all the gluten in the world and launching it into space where it can't not hurt us ever again." 

LOL Unreal.
ITT: Memes, memes for days.
I bet that Vanessa dies in the first 10 minutes
Ryan trolls her on Twitter often, so I am guessing she probably said something like what Deadpool's girlfriend says to him in the scene from the trailer.
They might probably watch it together
Probably loved it, given how much they troll and have fun with each other.

+1 to Ryan.
I hope he's cleared the bad blood between him and Bandhoo
I love that there's a tie back to Van Wilder with the song he's listening to.

[Gwen Used Me For Her Story, Then Married an Ass Wipe... and Ran Over My Heart With a Big Metaphorical Truck. Originally performed by Air Supply. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LNGoLRy8Lg)
FOX offered 250 Million for the budget and Ryan Reynolds declined it.  The rumor is he settled on around 100 Million but the actual budget hasn't been confirmed.  He took less money specifically to keep them out of the production.   
Which one, Mcavoy or Stewart? These timelines are getting so confusing
And the editor of John Wick and Atomic Blonde.

It is indeed. 
Maybe his mutants power is to turn into a [dancing clown](https://media.giphy.com/media/XyAGm96eUIPsc/giphy.gif)?

$10 says there's a Pennywise or clown joke in the movie. 

Edit: Grammer thanks
 /u/JasterMereel42
I think so!

So happy he's getting so many roles!
And it looks like [Shatterstar](http://delinear.info/images/th3n04h/hd/Shatterstar-Marvel-Comics-X-Force-a.png) is right next to him behind Terry Crews (Bishop?).
>implying John Wick isn't an unkillable mutant
It'd be amazing if Deadpool says:

"Hugh Jackman, I love your movies. I would love to be in one."
I also really want to see stan lee's cameo involve deadpool accidentally, or purposefully, murdering him a la "Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe"
Except for the Super Healing, Deadpool is the most realistic superhero...hahaha
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/27_qmFNYldE?t=18)
It reminded me of the scene in civil war when Bucky tries to shoot stark, but stark has some Ironman glove. Although this is a much cooler version, also a good use of invulnerability powers. Reminds me a bit of Ajin (a manga/anime). In it some random people become immortal and upon death can regenerate. So one guy takes full advantage of this basically treating it like a video game with unlimited lives. 
Who was he playing? I missed that?
*Catastrophe* is so good. Too bad his real life wife is fucking her karate teacher.

Deadpool is skux confirmed. 
That's where he's from! Thanks I couldn't figure it out. For those who haven't seen it I'd recommend checking out Hunt for the Wilderpeople it's directed by Taika Waititi (director of Thor Ragnarok) and it's a very fun watch.
[Ricky Baker!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=us6ZcvCcYoo)
Definitely the kid from the Hunt for the Wilderpeople—which was a fucking great movie. 

Directed by Taika Waititi who did Thor 

It’s like every actor from New Zealand’s found their niche in America 
Ricky Baker!!!! One of my favorite movies and budding actors!
Scary Terry!
is he bishop?  that would be awesome.
You make it sound like she is aging surprisingly gracefully. The woman is still in her 30s. 
Indeed. Much like Monica Bellucci, or Helen Mirren.
Still Inara to me damnit
Have you seen her on Gotham lately? She is absolutely hot.
 Yeah and I think I saw him in a grey costume at one point. So it looks like they're giving him the Uncanny X-Force [costume](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/e/ef/Deadpool_%28Wade_Wilson%29_Uncanny_X-Force_31-22_%282012%29.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/311?cb=20121011194750) in this one, too, which is pretty cool.
Finally, all my first edition x-force comics will be worth something!

*sobs on to hermetically sealed bags*
They made fun of Fox studios in the trailer of the first one as well , "From the studio that inexplicably sewed his fucking mouth shut the first time"
".....and young enough to carry their own franchises for 10-12 years."  Pffff....lol!  
Did you see the synopsis under the video? 

>After surviving a near fatal bovine attack, a disfigured cafeteria chef (Wade Wilson) struggles to fulfill his dream of becoming Mayberry’s hottest bartender while also learning to cope with his lost sense of taste.

Meryl Streep cameo confirmed.
Devil Wears Prada. Low key quality movie. 
Devil Wears Prada was pretty good.  Anne Hathaway is great in it.
Grabbing Colossus' ass?
She got really hot since the last movie 
"stop at two, you've killed it"

Seriously though I'm worried of a future where Ryan Reynolds accidentally gets signed on for annual sequels that progressively get less and less funny. 
I bet they are talking about Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants in this scene :)
what you're not even gonna quote it and say something like 'this made me lol'?
If I remember correctly they basically sent out a different description mad-libs style to every different magazine and website that had the trailer.
I love how this just seems like random words stuck together.
*Holds up spork*
The title says 92 but the art says post 2002... And Deadpool in the center says at least 2012..

So saying always is a bit disingenuous.
No child left behind, no child left behind
Once rejected! Now accepted!
Post credits scene, Ryan in his Deadpool makeup in a trailer or something talking to Jackman saying "Come on, do *one* little scene in this, fans will go crazy" "*sigh* Fine." End movie.

And then watch jabronis go crazy wondering which scene he was in.
The fight choreography is one of my favorite things too.  And of course lines that include “pitty dick in your mouth”. 
Dat John Wick guy.
"God I miss cocaine." 
The Devils Wears Prada was a rollercoaster of emotions
Olivia Munn was Psylocke in the 80s. Deadpool is alot more open about not giving a fuck about continuity, so it’s likely. My guess is she’s Hisako Ichiki/Armor.
I'm just wondering who is the guy in white wearing that basic-ass signature Rob Liefeld head-gear.
> Purple hair says Psylocke. Powerset says Surge. But who knows?

Meh, last movie the name was Negasonic Teenage Warhead, but the powerset was Cannonball.  So obviously they're flexible.
Ant-Man and The Wasp doesn’t come until July 6 unfortunately.
[deleted]
No, it’s bill skarsgård from hemlock grove
It's being directed many John Wick's co-director, so it's no surprise the action feels a lot tighter and snappier than in the first film. 
[Even better, he's in stilettos!](https://imgur.com/a/IJLl1) ~~Laboutin's~~ stripper heels, I think 
> Never tried to be anything else 

That's patently false. Deadpool has a lot of great stories that fall on the more serious and dramatic side of things.
It itself isn't a game changer, but its existence and success definitely is. For a long time, Hollywood has seemed reluctant to market any kind of R-Rated property on a wide, multi demographic scale, outside of raunchy teen comedies, and even those started to peter off. Definitely not a superhero IP. Then Deadpool comes along and breaks a dozen different records, which demonstrates to the studios that the PTA groups aren't gonna burn down their building if they start allowing directors to shoot for R occasionally, rather than trimming everything down to appease the PG 13 crowd. 

Hopefully, it also taught them to give their directors some creative freedom as well - Deadpool succeeded not (solely) because it was raunchy, but because it was original and different from the existing competition. But that may be asking too much. The Hard R Gritty Caillou reboot is just weeks away from being announced, I'm sure. 
It's already earned more money than Justice League. 
She's listed as "Copycat" in the credits, so I think more interesting things are in store for her in the movie. 
She's also trolled him back a few times, only time I remember was a man crush monday post or something and it was Ryan Gosling instead of Reynolds
He probably got some help scaring Bandhoo into staying quiet.
Friendship ended with Bandhoo, now deadpool is my best friend.
You mean the blood from the carpet in his trunk?
Hard to say. Bandhu is as dishonorable as he is attractive. 
Thank God.  Creative control is such a big reason for the success of Deadpool, and Ryan appears to see and know how Fox has fucked the franchise.  
Ryan is smarter than I look.
Isn't that how he fell out with Tim Miller who wanted it to be much larger scale this time round?
Lol, typical studio thinking. The first one was so profitable with x million dollar budget. Maybe if we put 2x million in it it will be twice as profitable. 
I'm sure Fox is super excited for a a new successful franchise, but you have to be out of your mind to think having a $250 million budget is reasonable for a movie slated to release 3 weeks after Infinity War and a week before Solo.

Edit: I'm not arguing which will be better or what will make more money guys, so stop with the "Solo looks bad LOLOL" crap. The release strategy is what I'm talking about.

Edit 2: Summary of way too many comments "SoLO lOOkS baD, I'M NoT WaTCHinG iT sO DEadPoOL WoN't MaKE lESs beCaUsE oF A UGgggggGGGGGgge REleaSe afTeR iT!"


I mean they are going pretty intensely on marketing so fox seems to have re invested that money. This is their 4th trailer:

[1st- Logan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVJX7jTIPsc) 

[2nd - Bob Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FvFjyAwHxI)

[3rd - Cable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZNBFcwd7zc)

[4th - XForce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D86RtevtfrA&feature=youtu.be)
Wait, why is less money a good thing? This is still a Fox movie. Would taking a higher budget necessarily mean letting go of the creative control? I don't know how these things work 
The Bruce Willis one. 
Stewart.  McAvoy wasn't bald until the last one.
Yes I know.
And the stunt coordinator from Netflix's Daredevil, IIRC. The action shots in this movie should be top notch.
Is Atomic Blonde good?

The phone call, when the mob boss calls him to make things right and he's in his basement getting the guns. John Wick doesn't say a word, just hangs up after hearing him out, and the mob boss knows he's fucked.
[deleted]
Yeah. A lot those scenes were badass and exciting because of the dialogue.
Tons, actually. I don't even find it to be that action packed of a movie. It follows the John Woo method of having only a handful of action scenes but making each one very memorable. But even those are scaled down compared to what he would do. 

I hope it doesn't sound like I'm disparaging John Wick because I'm not, I love it. But something like The Raid is closer to pure action than John Wick is. 
The first thirty minutes of the movie was just dialog and world building. Which is why that movie is cool, they tell us John Wick is the fucking man and then they show us.  Usually its the other way around.  Seeing him pick up that gun and knowing what's about to happen is just a perfect moment. 
I loved the whole world-building John Wick did with the Assassin's Hotel, the coins, the code of honor. It was completely unnecessary for a brainless action flick but it made it so much more fleshed out and lived in. Such a great movie. 
It is It indeed.
DP definitely will call him “You fucking clown” at some point.
He was great in Hemlock Grove. Show kinda went off the rails but it was overall enjoyable. 
No, he isn't, he's just Keanu Reeves. He's too hot to die.
John Wick is the one you send to kill the unkillable mutant.
Baba Yaga
And a "keep dreamin' bub." In response
"What was it like to steal Meg Ryan and leave her in 1876?"
I hear a science-based, 100% Deadpool MMO is in development.

Woah what?

Also holy balls she was only 23 in Firefly
Gillian Anderson and Marisa tomei take the cake in this department

I saw that too, though I think he was just covered in drywall dust.
Seemed like it was burnt-ish.
No one makes fun of Fox better than Fox.
I think it's a miss step not calling it "Double DP" 
Really wish New Mutants was out on its original release date in April so they could've gotten more mileage out of this joke.
"They probably won't make it to 3."

"Why would they? You stop at 2, you killed it."

Someone should make a Dead Pool so we can bet on who's dying first.
X Force 😂
The first teaser had a different description on every social media place they uploaded it to.
That’s also been the movie’s synopsis on IMDB for a while (possibly always, but I didn’t look at it until the first trailer came out).
She's gonna play [Hellcow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellcow) in motion capture.
Low key? You mean high key
With excellent performances across the board, particularly Tucci gang. 
People make fun of me for saying it, but I loved that movie.  And Meryl Streep was awesome in it.

She was hot already. She just got hotter.

Deadpool is Reynolds baby. No way would he make a conscious effort to keep putting out sequels if he felt he could achieve something better than their predecessors. 

I'm thoroughly fucking excited for this.

I feel like they just grabbed a mad libs book to write this description. 
r/movies : *man I hate random humor...*

*I cant wait for deadpool 2 and the next season of rick and morty!*
It also say 2016 next to the nun-chucks.
The series is called X-Men ‘92, because it’s based on the 1992 X-Men animated series. That likely came out in the last year or two, since X-Men ‘92 started in 2015. 
[deleted]
[deleted]
To be fair the X-Men movies don’t give a fuck about continuity either.
Much as I'd love to see Armor on the big screen, I don't think it'll be her. She doesn't have anything to do with electric whips, and if it was her I'd expect to see her actually armored up instead.
Shatterstar. 
A bunch of Wolverine: Origins DVDs
Nope sorry but it's in fact Bill Skarsgard from Atomic Blonde 
Not Louboutins. They're a stripper heel - specifically the [Pleaser Delight 687-FH pump](https://www.shoefreaks.ca/pleaser-delight-687fh-pump). Another source [here](https://pleasershoes.com/products/delight-687fh).

Calves like those just don't *happen;* they need *work.*
It'll never happen but a movie version of "The Good, The Bad and the Ugly", his team-up with Wolverine and Captain America, would be outstanding, especially if they got Jackman and Evans to be in it.
I think he's talking specifically about the movies, in which case he'd be more or less correct. Movie Deadpool hasn't hit those dramatic story beats yet, at least not hard enough to make a lasting impact on the franchise. But hey, we'll see with the next 10 to 12 movies. 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he was one of the first male rape victims in comics. It was handled very seriously and such a shock comics would ever cover such a topic. 
>The Hard R Gritty Caillou reboot is just weeks away from being announced, I'm sure. 

The hard R is purely due to language as all of Caillou's  acquaintances tell him how they REALLY feel about him.
She was listed as Copycat in the first movie as well. 
The funny thing is that it was a photo of Gosling and Reynolds - only Reynolds was cropped out lmao
It was a happy birthday post where she cropped out Reynolds 
Well seeing as he was stuffed into the trunk then the cab gor rear ended pretty solidly I'd say Bandhoo is dead or seriously injured. 

Also DP's bag of guns was in the backseat. DP is going to have to break Dopinder out of jail.
[deleted]
This is my ‘I’ve been on Reddit too long’ moment.
I mean after waiting for Deadpool to happen for so long, only makes sense that he’d treat his baby right
Hell in 2009, he was walking, non-talking evidence that FOX fucked up.
Also, a smaller budget made the first movie better. The reason why Deadpool left the guns in the cab was because they couldn't get funding to do a giant shooting scene at the end. 
That's a backhanded compliment if I ever saw one.
Basically what happened was Tim Miller got his CGI Studio, Blur, to do the beginning of the film for basically free in exchange they were supposed to use Blur exclusively for the sequel. Then the movie made more money than any other X Film in history and Reynolds decided that the low budget and total control was crucial to the success of the franchise. 
If it pays off, certain executives are getting x million dollar bonuses.
They make this joke in 22 Jump Street, there's a lot of meta humor in that movie.
Specially when they didn't have any faith in the first one and Ryan had to wait so long to make it. 

Studios really don't know jack shit when it comes to creativity. Which is why so many of them failed and bailed from my country. They lost huge money thinking the same thing.
Reminds me of 22 Jump Street and the running gag about sequels they keep talking about in terms of catching the dealer the same way. "do the same thing you did last time, that worked."
> I'm sure Fox is super excited for a a new successful franchise, but you have to be out of your mind to think having a $250 million budget is reasonable for a movie slated to release 3 weeks after Infinity War and a week before Solo.

True while at the same time showing they completely misunderstood what made the first one so successful.
Big money comes with strings and those strings are generally tied to very stupid people. You don't want stupid people in a creative position with power over the production.  
Less budget means less to lose when it goes up against 2 of the biggest movies of the year. Terrible time to release this movie. They need to wait til after solo or release before infinity war.
The bigger the investment, the more control they are going to want.
Deadhard. Love that movie
[deleted]
Good Lord, this could be a perfect storm of action. 
He also did that ridiculously cool scene at the end of the Punisher episode "Kandahar" where Frank single-handedly destroys an ambush. Similar tone to the Daredevil hallway scene he did. Easily my favorite stunt coordinator working right now, dude knows how to do an outnumbered hero kicking ass scene, can't wait to see what he does here.
Fighting in hallways confirmed. 
Action, editing and visual style is awesome. Don't expect oscar level story and dialogue though. Fun movie

**Wick:** Hello, Francis.  
**Francis:** Mr. Wick.  
**Wick:** *You've lost weight.* [italics is Russian]  
**Francis:** *Over 60 lbs.*   
**Wick:** *Yeah? Impressive.*  
**Francis:** Are you here on business, sir?  
**Wick:** I'm afraid so, Francis. [pause] Why don't you take the night off?  
**Francis:** [Takes off his earpiece, turning around] Thank you, Mr. Wick. [walks away]  

Such a great scene that says so much with so little dialog.  We know Wick and Francis have worked together.  He knows him well enough to see the weight loss. But they aren't close friends or Francis wouldn't be so nervous.  Yet Francis, played by 6'10" tall, 300 lbs. Kevin Nash knows so clearly he is outclassed by Wick.  His body language shows he had no intention of trying to fight because he knows he would lose.

Just a great scene that establishes the world, the scene to come and the character of John Wick in less than a minute of screen time.


[deleted]
John wick is one of the greatest action films ever in my opinion. Fantastic in almost every way 
Hence his mutant ability: Sex-pervious - so hot that you become impervious to death.  

Keanu Reeves is an immortal.
It would be confusing if Hugh Jackman had an American accent though.
It's mostly about deadpool breeding though
That was by far my favorite Reddit moment I think 
This is a reference I haven't seen in a while 
What a sick reference, my dude.
I hope he actually gets a cameo and not just a photo reference for when they're looking for team members
That's a running gag on his Twitter account. 
Damn I Just googled him and his son died of cancer in February as well. Poor dude
Hahaha his wife does karate, it's just a running gag on his Twitter account where he tweets stuff about his wife staying at karate practice late and fans telling him she's fucking her karate teacher. It's just a silly fun thing he has with the fans.
I feel like every Kiwi movie we hear about recently is either made by or with Taika Waititi.

At this point I'd suspect there's a Taika Waititi cinema school where every teacher is Taika Waititi.
Now I’m hungry.

He sure says 'bitch' a lot.

I saw that too, but I was secretly hoping he just played himself in the movie. I think that would've fit the Deadpool franchise perfectly. Terry Crews is basically a superhero already.
You can see his headshot in the trailer with 'Bedlam' written underneath though?
Firefly she was cute, 38 she is hot as balls.
Marisa Tomei in those high wasted jeans in Spider-Man: Homecoming...man she looked great. 
DEFINITELY Marisa Tomei. WOW.
You can't forget Kate Beckinsale. 
Probably as a nod to the X-Force costume
It was the flower or cocaine
True story.  Just look at The Simpsons.
I bet it’d be something like New Mutants takes themselves too seriously. 
I just wish New Mutants had stuck with its original release date because I was really, really excited to see it.
That's what they were talking about? I thought that was a joke about the Deadpool franchise itself. Like, *they won't make a third one*. I gotta be honest, I didn't get that one properly, was confused. 
Why is x force funny? It's a real team. 
It was like Deadpool Mad Libs.

Yeah like 27 dresses is bad but how fucking dare they come for The Devil Wears Prada and try to compare the two
Tucci has the Golden Touch. He makes any movie he's in instantly better. Yes, even Burlesque.
Don't forget my boy Vinny Chase
Emily Blunt was great in that movie.
THE TUCC IS LOOSE
Tucci gang Tucci gang Tucci gang ^^^^^^^^^mrmrmrmrmmmrmrrmrr
Definitely one of her best performances.


The movie came out the same day as Superman Returns. Streep was probably a better Lex Luthor than Kevin Spacey.
As opposed to all the other times when she wasn´t awesome, like in her what 15 oscar nominations and the reputation of greatest living film actor?
People don’t make fun of you for that. 
The Collosass.
Dude, she was like....

_\*looks up age\*_

Really? 19? Wow.
They should be put this as a tag line on a poster 
I think that is why Deadpool 2 seems to in fact be an X-Force movie. More characters can share the load and keep it interesting, while the first installment almost entirely focused on him which would definitely get old by part 3. 
holy shit
IIRC, that's essentially exactly what they've been doing with several of their video descriptions.
The selfie stick was a bit telling also.
There's a comic based on a cartoon that was based on a comic?

How deep does it go?
To be fair ~~the X-Men movies~~ Fox don’t give a fuck about continuity either.

>>Shatterstar comes from the planet Mojoworld (about a century in the future, as opposed to the Mojoverse which co-exists with the contemporary Earth dimension, making him a time traveler as well as a dimension-hopper) which is ruled by the alien tyrant Mojo.

Sold, sold, a million times sold.
Forth wall breaking and something that makes you question the X-Men timeline? Seems like it's possible 
Sorry boo nah it's Bill Skarsgård, Alexander's brother.
I have no idea what that story is, but I'm guessing Captain America is The Good, Wolverine is The Bad, and Deadpool is The Ugly?
Eh, there's sprinkles of it here and there. One of the lines that stuck out the most to me wasn't one of the countless jokes, but Wade in the doctor's office: "Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z... Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face, like it's the first time I'm seeing it... or the last."
THAT'S RIGHT, I remember it better now.
Anyone have a link? That is hilarious lol
I’d love to see that as a little 15 minute short tbh. Deadpool and friends trying to Shawshank Dopinder out of jail.
Bet it felt huge in his hands
Important to remember it wasn't just him, but Tim Miller as well. His goal of doing Deadpool was a huge motivation for him to lead the visual design of Scott Pilgrim. 

Yet for some reason him and Ryan had a falling out over this movie. 
Imagine if they'd had *this* Deadpool in *that* movie, though?  He would have outshone... anything and everything about that film.  I can **almost** understand why they made him mute, if for no reason other than Reynolds would have been the highlight of that film.

Swords out of his arms?  I've got nothing for that, though...
The second time, the first time it was always in the script.
Curious, do you have a source on that?

Cause if I recall they still had a shit ton of explosions and gunfire and a fucking aircraft carrier falling over. Can't see how him having guns would put them that much more over budget.
not if hes ass ugly
That’s a shame because Blur are absolutely amazing, I’m sure the collaboration wouldn’t have hurt. 
Yeah, I know everyone loves latching onto the "Tim Miller wanted to sell out Deadpool 2, Ryan Reynolds wanted to keep it cool and cheap" but it really seems like Tim Miller got fucked here. I also don't think it's even true (this trailer has TONS of expensive choreography and CGI in it).
It seems like good will on both sides. Here's how I can see it happening. 

Tim Miller cares primarily about the bigger picture and ambition. He wants to go full budget and show everyone what both him and Reynolds can do, potentially setting a precedent for further blockbuster scale projects, even more Deadpools. He maybe also, or even just, wants to risk the studio control so they can be more ambitious on this project as far as set pieces, length, etc.  

Reynolds cares primarily about Deadpool, and what's worked. He wants to keep the budget smaller in order to minimize studio interference and retain the creative control that made the first movie successful.  He wants to play it safer with the scale of the movie, keeping the set pieces more down to earth, keeping the length shorter, etc. This may also just be in keeping with his vision of his own Deadpool: it serves to foreground the character rather than the plot. 
That beginning was a solid 11/10. It's a shame Miller got the shaft after holding up his end of it. I assume there was compensation? 
X gon give it to ya
I prefer 22 JS to 21 JS purely for that reason. It's incredibly self-aware

The events that take place in "Logan" are far in the future.  Deadpool 2 happens before Logan.
You might say it could be a Ballet of Death
John Wick makes a cameo.
There's a cool theory I saw on reddit that says the part about weight loss was actually Francis warning Wick in code about the number of guards inside.

This isn't the original post I saw but this explains it nicely.

[Here's the scene if anyone wants to see it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8goQyjvcjdo) I didn't realize that was Kevin Nash so I looked it up. 
Indeed. They did really well with crafting John Wick's mystique and notoriety among his assassin peers, even making him seem like a monster from antiquity that would appear and kill you simply by uttering his name. 
> "........oh"

That oh, and he putting the phone down. It shows so fucking much with no dialogue. You really know at that point that he done fucking up.
Leguizamo (sp?) fuckin' killed it in that movie. He plays that character, even though it's a small part, absolutely perfectly. 
It’s brilliant because it perfectly sets up a huge scary mob boss hellbent on revenge, then tears it down entirely in the next line. God, I love that movie.
Or Canadian. 
A giant wrinkled ball sack stretched over a man that's fucking Morena Baccarin?  Yeah, I'd watch that.
Ooh, this is vintage 
Once you get the concept art down, the rest of the game just develops itself.
Just looking for developers!
he is in the trailer at the 1:40 mark in the back of the airplane, so he is definitely in it. 
As much as I love Rob Delaney, I think it would be really funny to have his role just extend to a headshot. But he's still like 6th billed. 
Damn, I thought he had it going on. Maybe why I haven't seen him on Twitter much
His mother on the show was played by Carrie Fisher.
Yeah, but it's not as funny to his sons Chambee and Davoile.
Oh shit ok, I was like man that sucks for him.
I would watch a Taika Waititi movie about that.

NZ is a small country and there's actually only 13 of us. Taika has been designated as movie director while Peter Jackson is re-assigned to waste control management after the cgi heavy hobbit movies.
I fucking love that movie, would recommend anyone looking for something to watch to give it a try.
I watched this movie up to this point and turned it off thinking, "My wife needs to watch this too", and for the first part she was like,

 "what are you making me watch?" and I had to keep just saying, 

"just wait.  Just wait."

This silly, lovely, heartwarming song is what clinched it for me and her.  Movie is so good.  
Of course that’s right you egg

Hmm, you're probably right then, I was told he was GW Bridge but maybe people were just guessing. Crews looks like he would fit Bedlam just as well as GW Brdige.
They dressed her up like classic Aunt May to down the hot aunt look but that didn't really help haha. 
That was no waste
marisa tomei was hot during the seinfeld era and still remains hot
She even looked great in that picture of the horse sneezing on her.
Yea, never thought I'd want to be Uncle Ben.
Or Jennifer Connelly. 
He'll look in the mirror and make a comment about the new look being uncanny or something. 
And Futurama!  
I'll give it to Fox, I appreciate their derogatory self-refetential humor.
I like the family guy episode when first back after being somewhat suspended and just listed off a huge list of shows that were canceled by fox while they weren’t on 
Yea like what are they gonna do? Sue themselves lol. 
I got the same impression as you. It was right after the Deadpool 2 logo so I'm being that's the case. Also, he breaks the fourth wall as part of his schtick. I love it.
I thought that (while making a joke about the Deadpool franchise) he was talking about Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2. 
I assumed it'd be a running gag that Deadpool would be talking about Sisterhood of The Traveling Pants
I think it's just poining out the side of the comics that's not particularly original and is just using the formers name in hopes of a successful spin-off X-Men, x-force ..that's how I took the joke anyway 
It's lampshading how derivative the original comic book series was. The whole "every person even remotely related to the X-Men have to dress exactly the same with X's over everything so people buy their comics" has been a running joke for decades.
The tucc is loose
Even Stanley couldn't help the mess that is the transformers series hahaha...

Love him tho, great low-key underrated actor

You mean Aquaman?
Indeed. One of the first performances where I started paying attention to her rise. 
My favorite part was where she pursed her lips and *everyone* immediately had a meltdown and someone's career got ruined. Like holy damn that is some evil boss shit. 
Yeah. I checked that right after the movie. Lol
That would be nice. Make DP a supporting character/co-star in other R-rated Marvel superhero movies. To be fair, a Deadpool/Punisher or Deadpool/Spiderman crossover would be sick, especially because watching Ryan Reynolds fuck with Tom Holland the way Deadpool is always fucking with Spiderman would honestly be amazing.

That's a selfie nunchuck you plebe.
Okay, peep this homeboy. Ultimate Spider-Man is a comic that’s based on another comic. There was a show based on _that_ comic. And then a comic based on that show. And then a motion comic based on _that_ comic.
It’s actually Bill Skarsgård from Deadpool 2
Somebody has been brainwashing Deadpool, using him for hits, then wiping his memory. During one I his blackouts he knocks up a lady and has a kid. Deadpool blows her off because he thinks she's nuts. He finds out about the blackouts and goes to Cap and Logan for help. They blow him off. His "handlers" find out Deadpool knows and kidnap all three of them as well as the woman and baby. They are working with the North Koreans, who want their own super human weapons. It ends up being a North Korean prison camp breakout with DP, Cap and Logan alongside some poor North Koreans who have been muilated into becoming knock-off X-Men.

It also has some very emotional moments.

One of my favorite bits is when Cap stands in front of the entire NK army and they're too terrified to attack him.

Dopinder sitting in his cell staring at a picture of Gita on the wall. Suddenly a poo covered Deadpool bursts out of the wall and tears through Gita's picture.

DP: Oof, I should have taken a left at Pelican Bay. I mean jesus, how much corn to they serve here?!?! Anyway, where's my bag of guns Dopinder????

About the size of a KFC spork. 
The size of your budget doesn’t matter, it’s how you use it.
Miller wanted a high budget super hero movie.

Not Reynolds. 
I find it amazing how quickly fans turned on Miller, given that he was a major driving force behind the success of the first one. In my honest opinion, the action set pieces were the best part of the first movie, way more so than the Waypool humor which is usually hot or miss.
Edit: Cmon guys it was a slip of the thumb. I and O are right next to each other.
Can you expound on the Scott Pilgrim factor? Link?
Barakapool
Fun Fact : Because the Wolverine Origins script was so bad, Reynolds improvised all of his lines.  Hugh Jackman had to leave during the elevator scene because he couldn't keep a straight face.
They did have this Deadpool in that movie for two scenes. And he totally stole the film.
It shouldn't have been the real deadpool. But the point is that there was no need to even have him in the film just to not use deadpool. They should have went with a different character. 
Well it was a wolverine movie and that was their cash cow and they were probably worried about some unknown character crowding out the star attraction. Just imagine if deadpool has been some big obnoxious character in that movie pulling oxygen away from wolverine and deadpools jokes fell flat with audiences?
Honestly swords out of his arms would have worked for regular DP. I can very clearly imagine him pushing swords through his hands after wolverine takes out his claws while saying 'I can do that too' followed by 'oh god that hurts!' after they come out. 

'Why are we even doing this? We both regenerate. Are we just going to keep cutting each other until we tire out like a fat emo girl?'
Didn't he also have laser eyes? 
Was it? From what I remember from reading that leaked script (other than being shocked how informal it all looked) was the fight at the end with Colossus vs Kane (replaced with Angel in the actual movie because then they didn't have to CG the cybernetic parts, but Angel Kane is a cute joke) there was a lobby shootout scene that was reminiscent of The Matrix and then Collosus and Kane basically fought so hard the building came down instead of the whole aircraft carrier tipping over thing.

EDIT: They also cut two montages from the movie probably because each little blip is a whole scene that probably costs as much as a full scene for only a few seonds of footage, to anyone interested they are as follows:

* After escaping Deadpool simply tries to kill himself. They play it off as a trailer for a silly movie "Wade Wilson is... hard.... to... kill" and with each word a grandiose suicide attempt is shown. (I think crashing a car and jumping from a building are two I remember) I imagine each of these shots, the wounds, and regeneration would have cost a lot which explains why it was cut.
* Angel and Francis are supposed to take over Hellhouse and pick up loads of money picking up the backlog of despicable jobs they wouldn't do. There was supposed to be a gut-wrenching montage of them doing despicable things instead of just being your friendly neighborhood anti-heroes as Hellhouse was portrayed. Also probably cut for budget.
Be quiet, Deadpool was a small indie masterpiece

https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-makers-of-deadpool-had-to-slash-7-million-from-the-1758147495
No source handy on mobile, but from what I read  the planned shootout at the end was going to be an elaborate stunt heavy affair with Deadpool leaping through windows and shit.

I would say that coordinating something like that is more cost intensive than a quick "kill the grunts" fight scene followed by a bunch of CGI. 
Technically, a majority of the budget went to that CGI in the climax, so yes, he could be right...
I have no idea what they've done in actual cinema. I just know they're the goto studio for when you need an attractive trailer for a game you haven't made at all yet.
Fuck waitin for ya to get it on your own, X gon deliver to ya
Yeh me too. I love that bit where they look down the street and there's building work going on at 23 jump street that's bigger than their current base 
Ah yes, awesom-o
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick? 
This is healthy.
That makes a lot of sense actually.


Damn it móvies you're cool as frick
The only thing I don't agree with in the analysis is when he assumes Francis is turning around to "hammer" wick. If you watch the body language, you can see that he actually relaxes as he turns around.

This would tell me that Francis is shit scared of John, knows that he is out matched and that he is relieved that John isn't there for him as well because the outcome would be grim for Francis.
Does he kill 60+ people in the club?
Such an honest, “thank you sir”
That 'oh' tells you that what Aurelio just said made this Russian mob boss completely forget that the guy he's talking to knocked his son to the ground. Because something *much* more important has come up.
Such a great piece of writing and execution.  I don’t think any action movie has ever as easily made you respect that talents of the hero without showing them to you quite like that scene in wick did. 
Man, I love some John Leguizamo. He and Harold Perrineau were both amazing in Romeo+Juliet. 
He is legit my favorite actor. I really wish he had more big parts. Empire and a Pyromaniacs love story are 2 of my fav movies
I’m from Minnesota. They sound the same to me.
Only reddit kids will remember 
Yeah. He took a hiatus for awhile. But he's back now and seems in better spirits given the horrible circumstances. 

if you haven't read his autobiography, he's a dude that's been through a hell of a lot in his lifetime. 
I would watch a Deadpool/Taika movie.
"you're more like Sarah Connor, and in the first movie too, before she could do chinups"

Agreed, it was Paula that kept me going til the birthday song, then I knew for sure this was something special.

Futurama had more of a reason too than Simpson's

Actual X-force goes beyond the R-rating though haha, Wolverine, Warpath, Wolfsbane, X-23, Metal Arch Angel slicing everyone that stands in their way. 
I remember the height of this was the early 90s. The had X-Men Blue, X-Men Gold, X-Force(led by Cable), X-Factor(led by Havok), Excalibur(led by Nightcrawler)


Most of the characters had hella pouches on their costumes.
Chills.
Whenever I need a reality check I just watch her [Cerulean monologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5WWy_0VLS4)
Spideypool is an absolute dream. And Tom Holland would be a great match to Reynolds, he’s got pretty decent comedy chops 
It's actually Bill Skarsgard, the third best Skarsgard sibling. 
That sounds amazing and I must read it.
Is this a real comic?
That is great and makes me want a buddy-buddy movie with Reynolds, Gosling and Lively all in it.
>Oof, I should have taken a left at Pelican Bay

Albuquerque. You should always take a left at Albuquerque.
You're right, to a point, and this goes both directions. A smaller budget forces filmmakers to get creative to meet their goals, which often times will mean better story telling and more convincing practical effects, but sometimes there are things that just look and work better with a large budget. 
What would Star Wars Episode 9 look like with a five million dollar budget?
That's what she said
I think Deadpool is all about the characters, humor and amazing fight scenes. Not countless explosions or expensive CGI. 
Interesting, I heard that Miller wanted it more focused on Wade and character building, while Ryan wanted it to be more goofy, raunchy comedy with less character development.  Wish I could find the source though.
> Fox Execs:  What?  Barakapool not weird enough for you?  Ok.  Then let's just go ahead and have his eyes shoot frickin' laser beams.

It was at that point I became convinced Fox is run by Dr. Evil.
How DID he bend his elbows with the blades retracted?
And that scene was probably one of the best in the the entire film 
*Wade Wilson is sharpening his swords*

Wade Wilson: I love this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world, and you wanna know why?

Victor Creed: No.

Wade Wilson: It's memorable. Sure it's a little bulky, tough to get on a plane. You whip out a couple of swords at your ex-girlfriend's wedding, they will never, ever forget it.

Victor Creed: That's funny Wade, but I've think you've mistaken me with someone who gives a shit.

Wade Wilson: Granted, it's probably not as intimidating as having a gun, or bone-claws, or the fingernails of a bag-lady...

*Victor draws his claws, Wilson draws his blades*

Wade Wilson: Manicure?
Deadpool 2: 500 Days of Nate Summers.
This made me laugh. Thank you, stranger.
They haven't done much in cinema indeed but [their resume](http://www.blur.com/work/) is incredible. They have very high standards. 
the entirety of halo wars 2 and halo 2 anniversary the cutscenes are pretty sexy in those
Knock, Knock?
How 'bout, Ryan Reynolds wears a fat suit and pretends he's married to Sandra Bullock while he skips college classes.
When me President?  They See.  They See.  
He kills 28.
To add to that that thought, I got the "Oh..... well now what you did makes perfect sense.  Thank you for foreshadowing to my son what I'm going to do when I see him.   And what Wick is going to do but a thousand times worse.  Have a good day and don't worry you're not in trouble.  I'm in trouble.  Fuck."

But of course "Oh....." was perfect and needed none of my needless droning to get the point across.  I love bits like this in movies.
He did some great stand up back in his early days, too. [Freak still holds up imo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0UfSlPx7Lk&list=PLC02pFkh-IDExTMQYvGBC8Ee2UjpnGVgu)
Seriously, still one of my favorites. And Spawn, as well. The movie itself is pure 90s, but Leguizamo was just SO fucking awesome as Violator.
UK. Me too.
Taika Waititi as Bob: Agent of Hydra.

Yeah, I know he had a sort of cameo in the first one, but we don't know for certain that was the same Bob.
Yeah but The Simpson’s can *keep* doing it.  
Woof
I mean thats the new xforce.  Old xforce wasnt at all r rated

Comics have some incredibly ridiculous plot lines that are hilariously fun. 
Yes it's real. It's one of the hardest hitting Deadpool stories out there. 
So, porn?
Lots of interior ship shots and surprised expressions?
No she didn't

And if she did she didn't mean that

She'll always want a bigger budget
Because this explains the insane amount of CGI in the movie, the explosions, and the flying x-men bird. Yes. Today none of those were in the trailer or will be in the movie...
/s  
  
Deadpool is about giving great fun, without trying to be too serious about it, and still deliver a story somewhere under it all. It has expensive CGI and a lot of explosions (seriously, have you seen the first movie??), but without the super expensive over the top and ridiculous expensive and pointless writers, that can keep it both in decent budget and still make it work.  
  
250M could get them x-men characters, more elaborated sets and higher profile actors. Since they don't need those, 100M is enough for all the CGI and explosions they need.
I seem to recall his moveset in Ultimate Alliance including lasers and teleportation, although I think he achieved those feats with tech rather than mutations.
CGI
Are you by chance a... pleasure model ? Have you been programmed to satisfy, urges of humans ?
I don't speak italian, but that part translates as "over 60 pounds," but he actually says "kilogramos" as part of the sentence, which I'd assume is kilograms? "Over 60 lbs" is "over 27.2 kg," therefore 28 guards.
the difference is that Americans end sentences with fuck and Canadians end them with sorry
Oh yeah? Well we all want smaller suitcases to throw our budget in!
In the first place, it's not as if 100 million is some low budget indie flick where they have to film in the warehouse with paper-mache sets.
It does, but nowhere near what Miller wanted. They cut several action sequences for budget reasons. It's why Deadpool forgets his guns at the last showdown.

I've read the original script. It was great, but it gained a lot losing those scenes in favor of more time for the cast to joke around. A lot of the best jokes weren't in the script and a lot of what was in there was derivative or straight up stolen. Like the "brown pants" joke that was featured in all the trailers. That joke is really old. It works from Deadpool, but there were too many jokes like that in the original draft. It's pretty clear Reynolds and Miller really punched it up with improv, which they might not have gotten to if they were busy in mocap or action sequences.
I could see some Weapon X intern fucking up the installation of lasers behind his eyes, that ended up obliterating said eyes every time they activated, and they just left it like that because he can regenerate.

Hot damn. Look at math person making my morning. I didn't have to Google anything. Sweet.

Thanks!
But he says, in Russian (not Italian), "20 kilograms". I didn't read the thread OP linked to in the entirety, but I don't think this theory holds up, unfortunately.
Yeah pretty sure 100m still counts as AAA.
I could also see Deadpool doing that to himself, just so he can say he has fucking laser beams.
