Fantastic Suits and how to find them amirite
Oh shit, Nicholas Flamel
Is that the Mirror Of Erised that Dumbledore sees Grindelwald in?!
Spoiler alert- Dumbledore lives.
Hype reached peak when I saw Elder wand......
Damn. Costume design is on fucking point.
Very curious to see how the Nicolas Flamel story will tie in with Grindelwald's. Also, was that an invisible body with only a gauntlet at 1:29 ?
Good to see they haven't completely dropped the whole beasts element of the series. 
I'm impressed with how well the actor of young Newt has taken on Eddie's mannerism. It actually feels like you're watching young Newt instead of some random young kid.
I'm gonna fuckin' love Jude Law in this.
Absolutely love the parallel with the Bogart lesson.  That scene is part of the reason why Prisoner of Akzkaban is such a great film.  It is a great way to add character development in a fun and interesting way.
Grindelwald in the Mirror of Erised. Dayumnnn. 
I loved Ezra Miller in the first film. I'd love for him to have more screen time in this one, but it doesn't look like it. He's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors.
this universe is really cool.
I love Dumbledore's "put outer" light contraption. I just love it, not sure why I'm so enamored with it. 
Newt's boggart was awesome.

GIGGLING  

SOUND


These trailers are making me feel nostalgic. I was a huge HP fan growing up and would constantly watch all the trailers before the movies came out; multiple times a week. 

And I remember the awe and excitement I felt at the time. I think it’s amazing that these trailers make me feel the same way now. 
I'm in Hall H and I can't tell you enough of how much fun that panel was.  They gave out electronic wristbands before the panel started and then a video began playing.  We were inside of Newt's briefcase which he opens and says, "welcome to Paris".  The stage lights brightened and there was Eddie on stage with a wand.  He started waiving it and the 6500 wristbands all lit up while the music soared.  It was truely a magical feeling.  They then brought out the cast and asked normal QA.  This was interrupted by darkness, and then Johnny Depp came out in full costume, gave an amazing monologue, and then  vanished in darkness.  I'm so glad I got to see this today.

Edit :. Here is a potato quality photo of my wristbands lighting up with Johnny in the background http://imgur.com/gallery/uU6n8V4

I'll post my high res pics tomorrow
Maybe its just my phone's brightness but this movie looks more vibrant and less darker. That theme always gives me chills feels like cheating.
Good thing Hermione checked out Flamel’s book for some light reading. 
*sound of bones snapping in Flamel’s hand*

Jacob, weakly: “You don’t look a day over 375”

Okay, I cackled
I still miss Colin Farrell ngl
**Are we going to see Tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort in this series?**


According to Harry Potter Wiki Tom Riddle was born on December 31, 1926. Fantastic Beasts and where to find them was set in...1926. The five part series will lead up to Dumbledore's defeat of Grindlewald in 1945. Thus, we will see nearly a twenty year time period in which we could possibly see Tim Riddle/Lord Voldemort in his youth within the movies.

If we do see him, I am very excited to see if Voldemort took some influence from Grindlewald in his youth that helped shape his character as to how we get to see him in the nineties.

Edit: It could also be interesting if Credence is from the same orphanage as Tom Riddle 
Those cat beasts are... Intriguing.  I hope we get an explanation for them :3
That was a very well made trailer. Super hyped now.
I just love JK Rowling so much for creating this Universe!
1st one was an awesome surprise (especially seeing that I'm not the biggest fan of the harry potter series). I can't wait to see this one! 
Honestly, Depp's take as Grindlwald is growing on me. 
Holy shit, Jude Law is *perfect* as young Dumbledore. 
omg Nicholas Flamel HOW HYPE IS THAT
I'm glad to see they've roped Jacob back into things. Dan Fogler was absolutely my favorite character in the first one; sort of brought everything together with a well-played character and sense of wonder and bravery that fit in perfectly. It helped that he was just straight-up a solid good dude even when over his head. Between the writing and the actor nailing the performance, I'm glad to see him back.
I can't have been the only one to see the ginger girl in the DADA lesson and think Weasley.
Johnny Depp doesn’t seem so bad in the role of Grindewald now.
All aboard the hype train!!!!! Can't wait! 
The hype train has officially departed and has no plans of stopping
So we all saw [the elder wand at 2:40 right?](https://i.imgur.com/BLo5CTp.png)
Eeeeeey! So we finally meet ol' Nicky Flam-flam!
I really like the look of this, plus any time I get to spend in the Harry Potter Universe (HPU) is always a bonus. I wasn’t as mad about the Depp reveal from the first as some people were, he looks intriguing here
I honestly don't know which one gets you all tingled up more regardless of the quality of the trailer or film itself, the Force theme or Hedwig's theme *especially* when the main motif is reimagined 
this is one movie i will see in theatres
Even though Grindelwald is supposed to be less of threat compared to Voldemort at his peak, man am I excited to see how OP they make Grindelwald. Voldemort in the HP series was a shadow of his former self and not as powerful, but now in the Fantastic Beasts series, it'll be actual magical awe inspiring fights. YEEEET

I can't wait to actually see magical fights and battles again. The first movie was great because it was centered around adults, and not children that were still learning to use spells half the year, and the other half of the year not able to practice because of the trace. Now it's time for some actual adults throwing out spells fighting a dark lord in his actual prime. 
I hope they don't retcon Dumbledore's duel with Grindewald and have Newt defeat and capture him.  

Also this trailer makes me realize how bad I just want a Dumbledore focused prequel instead of the fantastic beasts trilogy that we're getting.
so there is like a Zoologist guy, and Dumbledore appoints him to take down some an organization of racial supremacist terrorists?
Is that going to be his brother, confronting Grindelwald with him when he's talking about Dumbledore mourning for him?
I wonder what's going on with Queenie in this one. She looks so intense in these trailers.
Why is Dumbledore doing a lesson on Bogarts? He's a transfiguration teacher, that lesson comes under Defence Against the Dark Arts
Depp as Grindelwald is starting to grow on me. 
David Yates has mastered this universe. Just because they're HP/Wizarding World movies, doesn't mean they can't look fantastic. Ever since he came on board for the HP films, I've loved how he has created a great looking cinematic experience first while still keeping the spirit of the Wizarding World in tact.
Depp has done some pretty crappy things, no doubt about it. But in terms of the film alone, I'm cautiously excited to see him in this role.
The movie has [my fonts](https://www.waldenfont.com) all over its props. Can't wait to see it! 
Aight dat Jude Law Dumbledore is on point! 
So I didn't watch the first movie for a while because I thought a Harry Potter movie without Harry Potter would be pretty dumb. 

I saw it last night on a whim, and holy shit it's spectacularly alright. Not a masterpiece, but it was fun. And I'm actually excited to see this new one. 
I had no idea how much I wanted to see Jude Law in a gay role until I saw this trailer....what a beautiful man.
Looks beautiful. Better than first trailer.
I’ve literally just watched the first one and it was amazing I really enjoyed. I enjoyed it more than my kids did. I’ll be dragging them to the cinema to watch this one as it looks even better then the first. 
Is Dumbledore teaching Defense against the Dark Arts? Did that ever happen? As I recall he was the Transfigurations teacher.
Yo dumbledore is always sending kids to their dooms instead of facing the villains himself. As an avid reader and a huge fan of the books since elementary school, I could never get over the fact that his plans always involve some younger protege taking his place in the combat. 
I honestly think I'm going to enjoy this series more than Harry Potter by the time it gets to the same number of movies. Though it depends on how they handle Dumbledore and Grindelwald throughout it. Already disappointed they won't even suggest their affections in this one. 
I’m shooketh
Jesus Christ those blue eyed cats...

Creepiest noncreepy thing you can think of
God that opening mirroring Lupins lesson 1:1 gave me chills. I miss HP.
One interesting detail I noticed was, in the DACA/riddikulus scene, the black girl lined up behind Newt looked spaced out in all three scenes. People clapped for the girl who went before Newt and she just looked frozen. I wonder what's up with that? (I've always been very impressed and delighted with all the easter eggs in HP movies!)

E: just watched the trailer again, and I'm realizing that the girl is Leta Lestrange!
Anyone pissed they showed Credence in the trailer? Spoiled what would've been an epic moment in the film...
Fantastic costumes and how to wear them
The first one won an Oscar for costume design.
I miss Colin Farrell. 
I made a bulletin board for my dorm saying “Fantastic Feasts and Where to find them” last year and had photos of local food spots to try. Was one of my favorites. Also photoshopped my face onto newt’s so people would know who their RA was 
Which begs the question, why did Dumbledore and so many teachers dress up as actual wizards in the HP movies but in these movies they dress up in the modern style of muggles?
Total hype moment! Dumbledore was friends with him, right? Presumably he sent Newt to him for whatever needs doing in Paris regarding Grindelwald.
Nicholas Flamel looks much older than I'd expect considering he's been drinking the elixir
Harry, Hermione, and Ron talk about [Nicholas Flamel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g6_JpGSI5E) for those who need reminding.
The amount of trouble he will cause for Harry Potter so many years later...
Totally hyped for this movie!!
So are they going to call his immortality rock the Sorcerer's Stone or the Philosopher's Stone?
I was speechless when Nicolas Flamel introduced himself. #verymuchexcited
I said that out loud! Okay, I'll overlook Johnny Depp's flaws and watch this fucking movie. 
It is... shouldn't he be seeing his sister though?
Inb4 Grindelwald is also Dumbledore's boggart 
Dumbledore sees Grindelwald cause he desires Grindelwald the most.
Perhaps it's a Foe-Glass.  :D
Why is his desire Grindelwald? Does he secretly want to bone him?
How could you. 
Come on, I haven’t read the books yet.
Spoiler alert -  So does Grindelwald.  
Not if Snape has anything to say about it 
As does Grindelwald.

He's alive until one of the later HP books/movies when he... well gets killed.
Wasn’t that the deathly hallows symbol at the very end?
Can you answer this for me. How would the Elder wand be loyal to Grindelwald when Newt and Tina  disarmed him at the end of the first movie? 
[deleted]
I agree that they look great, but I’m sad that we don’t get to see them in robes...
Perhaps it was just a magical glove Dumbledore sent to show Scamander where D was waiting for him.
I was thinking a spell, like cast on a glove too point towards something your looking for
I think that this series will have a recurring theme of magical animals appear and be somewhat important to the story as a whole.
Those cats looked insane
I agree but I still think it was a mistake to name the series Fantastic Beasts. This thing is going to be 5 movies, like it or not. It seems unlikely that the beasts will be anything more than comic relief/rare tools throughout the series after the first movie. I wish they'd named it after Newt or Grindelwald or something.
Weird series title tbh... even this movie title is super lackluster
I actually thought it was Eddie.
I thought it was marvel-esque de-aging, is that not the same actor?
Wtff I thought it was just Eddie until I went back and rewatched it
In the original marketing he didn't seem to have the beard but man does he fit as Dumbledore with it. Perfect choice. 
I would have never even considered him in the role, but just from the trailers I hope he plays Dumbledore forever at this point.  I mean, after this series is done, he can just be in the next series when Harry's parents, young Sirius and Remus are at Hogwarts, right? Please?
I love Jude Law in just about everything. I'm not sure what it is.
Only thing that confused me about that is I thought Dumbledore taught transfiguration.
Apart from doing it for plot reasons it seems kind of silly though. It's like, lets get a bunch of 13 year olds into a classroom and have them all laugh at each other as they expose their greatest fears.
its like grindr for wizards
I feel like he's being set up for a way more important role in the 3rd. I was honestly surprised he was coming back, I thought he'd died at the end of the first. 
Probably unneeded around these parts but shout out to “We Need to Talk About Kevin”.
Thank you Kanye
it's the first form of magic we ever saw in the series
Official name is 'De-Luminator'
Deluminator, it’s the same one that’s given to Ron in Albus’ will in Deathly Hallows. 
I really want to see how it gets defeated! 
Yeah, who'd have thought. It's probably the most relatable fear for anyone, muggle or wizard: becoming a bureaucrat. 
Yeah I noticed that too. It's like the wilhem scream. It just pulls me out of it. Still hyped for the movie though.
Same!! ♥♥
wow that sounds amazing. Hopefully they release that  to the public
Damn, wish I could've been there
>	less darker

🤔 some refer to this as “brighter”
You call that light?
I love Jacob, he's just such an honest and warm character. It's so fun having a muggle to react to all the insanity really. 
Ditto, he really helped make the first movie
He was the best part about the first one and I would have loved to see him develop through the films as a personal antagonist of Newt’s, seeing how Dumbledore and Grindelwald already have a rivalry. A powerful, positioned man of MACUSA who joins Grindelwald because he wants to protect his own kind that badly makes for an interesting character. 

Oh well, what’s done is done.
Honestly, can't wait to see how Fandom continues to completely ignore canon to bring Graves back. 
He was really good but we haven't seen how Johnny Depp truly performs yet
The Johnnywald reveal saddened me greatly. Such a waste, could still have had him involved with Grindelwald but shit they wasted the character 
Actually If I remember Voldemort was much more then just influenced of Grindlewald.



Without Grindlewald there would be no Voldemort. More or less Voldemort and his follower are neo nazis and Grindlewald is litteraly Hitler.



The thing I hoped for though is that they actually had a scene where Grindlewald meats Hitler. I think somewhere it was hinted that this actually happend. 
>It could also be interesting if Credence is from the same orphanage as Tom Riddle

Unlikely. HBP clearly stated Tom grew up in a London orphanage, while Credence's story happened in America.
I don't see how we possibly couldn't. He opens the chamber in those years and will have just left hogwarts in the conclusion.
You know, I hadn't thought about it until seeing your comment, but JK Rowling heavily implied with those dates that Grindelwald influenced WWII and the Holocaust, and that his defeat ended the war.  Interesting dark note to the original series, but this would be one of the main plot points of the Fantastic Beasts one.  Seems like it would be a bit difficult to fit into what is essentially a kids' movie.

Also, I'm sure we will see Dumbledore going to the orphanage to meet 11-year-old Tom Riddle to tell him he's a wizard, no?
If he shows up it’s the last film. No point for him to show up if he is too young to do magic outside school unless it’s a short cameo inside the school. But I really wish he would show up. And Hagrid too, I assume he is one of Newt’s biggest fans.
The cgi on those look awful
And there are 4 more to come!
WB finally has a cinematic universe it can be proud of!
One reason I'm so glad we're getting more from this the Wizarding World is I didn't appreciate the Harry Potter films at the times they were released. It was only until the series ended that I realised how lucky I was to grow up with the books and films. So I'm just happy I've got another opportunity to really appreciate another series from Rowling.
I'm actually way more excited for this one than the first one. Seems like there's a lot more at stake.
Same. He looked goofy as fuck in the few shots from the first one, but he looks less goofy and more like a dark charismatic figure (ie Hitler) that could believably lead a fascist movement. The emphasis on bringing wizards out of the shadows could be a quite compelling storyline.
When the first Fantastic Beasts came out I felt like one of the only people who didn't mind the surprise reveal of Depp as Grindelwald, so it makes me happy to see others start to come around on him when we barely got a minute of him in the first one. 
And from what I've seen so far in the promotions, he looks good.
I hope people give Depp a chance before being judgemental.
I agree!  Although I am sad that we'll never see Colin Farrell as a wizard again.  I really like his portrayal in the first film.
I can't believe I had to scroll so far down to find this, Jacob was probably my favorite part of the first movie... I was pretty bummed when they did what they did to him at the end. Suuuuper glad he's back and getting mixed up in magical mayhem agian!
"Red hair... and a hand-me-down robe?! You must be a Weasley!"
i don't really see why dumbledore likes him though
I could live without the different eyes tho 
I kind of like that they’re changing the name to Wizarding World. It allows them to tell some stories without Harry and his friends
I believe there will be 5 total movies. I am quite sure Dumbledore v Grindelwald will be in the final movie. 

I am expecting Grindelwald will own Newt in a duel (but not kill him), or Newt will get lucky, duel Grindewald to a standstill until back up arrives, and Grindelwald will escape.
It's like asking Steve Irwin to take down ISIS.
Her hair isn't curled anymore, it makes me wonder if she's stressed, on the run, ...?
It's Hogwarts....they reassign teachers all the time....
Unless the Defence Against the Dark Arts class room has changed, it looks like he may well be the Dark Arts teacher.   

That said, they are transforming the bogarts form into something else, so that probably works as a Transfiguration topic as well. 
It might have only done so under Lupin, who prioritized beasts in his lessons. 
Wool coats never go out of style.
As always, I look forward to the tie-in clothing line.
You heard of the Fab Five, now let us introduce the Fan Five.
And a well deserved one, imo. It looks fantastic!
And rightfully so. The costume design is absolutely amazing. 
Has it been confirmed he won't show up anymore? I was super disappointed as well when I realized (And read) hes probably not going to be there again but they must have seen the reception he got and added him in...somehow?
Sexy
As Dumbledore aged he developed more conservative fashion tastes, moving back towards the traditional wizard's robes. As head master he applied gentle pressure to staff to follow suit resulting in the almost universal robes.

Or so the voice in my head informs me.
Why is he teaching DADA tho?
"Hey kid, wanna buy some philosopher stones? If you know what i mean"
> Dumbledore was friends with him, right?

I mean, it was only the entire reason for the first book/movie's plot.
According to Dumbledore’s chocolate frog card, they were ‘partners’ 
It preserves life not youth. 
Emma Watson had that annoyed expression perfected from the start lol
True MVP
or the amount of help, since that's how Dumbledore confirmed his theory Voldy couldn't touch him
Oh Joy :D This looks amazing! It might be the most magical of the movies yet!!! Excited :D
"The Stone" which was what the movies ended up using other than for a few instances. They might even make fun of it by using both names because you've got an American muggle there with someone saying "I think that's a stupid name".

I suppose American Anglophile purists would prefer **Philosopher's** though.
A few seconds before he said it I wondered if it was him.
ELI5 who that is?
He's a fine actor if he can get serious about it.
He actually seemed... Not terrible here? Pretty low-key, which I appreciate. Was really worried he'd ham it up. Cautiously optimistic on that front.

On everything front... Holy shit! I'm gonna be there midnight opening, because this looks fucking incredible. The Harry Potter hype is so real right now for me. 
He can be good when he tries. My concern is that at this point, why would he? The man is phoning another Pirates of the Carribean every other year to pay his bills and I don't think I've seen him make a run at a good performance in a while. 
It changes so that might just be what he wants at the time. remember, Harry usually saw his family but during the battle for the Philosopher's Stone, he saw himself holding it.
>“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Not
what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I
was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in
that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me
cowardly: You would be right, Harry. I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it
had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity,
but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.


>“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him
until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and
he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.

 >“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.”
 Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who
struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to
have to tell him. At last he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in
the mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it
had exercised over Harry.

I always read this as the first time he looked in the mirror he would have got the answer on who ended up killing Ariana. Seeing Grindewald in the mirror assuming it's the first time looking in it would then make sense and it would also finally convince and give him the courage to go after him.
Trailer maybe showed a very short part of that scene. 

I hope he sees his family in the mirror.
Maybe he doesn’t see his sister until after the battle with Grindelwald, like once he has closure?

So freaking hyped that their relationship is happening in the movies!
Maybe he wants the wand and Grindelwald has it?
>It is... shouldn't he be seeing his socks though?
JK rowling has confirmed Dumbledore is gay and that he loved Grindelwald so idk, this was after she died anyway.
Would it be Grindelwald or seeing himself kill his sister? 
I doubt he was after his sister’s death. What he wants most is her back and get rid of his guilt. And by now he has realized who Grindelwald truly is and is not blinded to his darker nature.
That's actually precisely why
That’s what Rowling said
Not so secretly. 
its strongly hinted at that he was in love with grindlewald and thats why he waited so long before stopping him
I can't believe you've done this
HE TRUSTED YOU!!!
Well grindelwald and dumbledore were obsessed with them in their youth. 
Maybe he got the Wand afterwards. We don't have a specific time line except that he was young. 
He didn't use the elder wand in the first movie. Lmao he would've killed them all if he did
We do. A number of times 
>D was waiting for him

;)

Well, when you have literal Dragons to fuck up the world, you better be using them
So did the Harry Potter series if you think about it. Hedwig, Dobby, Fawkes, Buckbeak, various dragons, the thestrals, just to name a few. 
I thought they looked very CGI/fake/plastic.  
I don't think so. He doesn't actually look like him. The only resemblance they have to me is the hair and a boyish face. De-aging is always kinda obvious at this point.
[deleted]
Then the Harry Potter reboot when he's an old man. 
A series of “The Marauders” would be amazing 
I mean...as long as JK Rowling still likes money they could possibly do that. When I saw, "Wizarding World" in the preview that is the kind of thing I thought they were doing. Like, holy shit look at the avengers. We have a whole world and an eager fan base too....
Maybe he's a substitute that day? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
What does a boggart do but transfigure itself?
Seems like a good icebreaker.
As long as no one is exempt from it, I don't see why it wouldn't bring you together. Everyone may laugh at your fear, but you'll laugh at theirs, and at the end, everyone's just laughing at fears, rather than each other.
IIRC the presence of multiple wizards/witches makes the Boggart less powerful because it doesn't know who to focus on.

It also kind of makes sense, 13-year-olds would likely have a lot harder time standing up to and laughing at their greatest fears by themselves 
Grindrwald.
That's what I've been wondering. I thought Credence died and Jacob was firmly left in his muggle version of life. Both returning surprised me, but Credence especially
Near the end of the film you see a little black flake of the obscurus escape out of the hole in the subway. I'm guessing that's how he survived.
One of my favorite films that doesn’t need a second watching. 
Holy fuck, that movie. I had never even heard of it before, then my little sister randomly showed it to me one day when she went through like a month long obsession with Ezra. Fan fucking tastic.
Is it magic or is it a mechanical device built with magic?
It’s called “PutOuter” in the fifth book, I just read it a couple chapters ago and was like Jo came up with this whole universe and couldn’t think of a better name for it?? :’D

so thank you for reminding me that I guess she did give it a name eventually haha
It's called putoutter until book 7 when the name changes
The hell would you use it for a classroom of 13 year olds though. That's like an 6 year old kid giggling at most.
You are less stupid than others.
And some refer as "darkn't"
You need a straight man to act as the audience would in the face of the insanity. Harry worked in the original stories, and now they're using Jacob. 
he is honestly the reason I will see this sequel. I just didn't connect with any of the other main characters at all, but he's just so entertaining and grounded while also being funny. I'm glad they brought him back.
It would be really easy to retcon in that Graves is alive. For all we know, Graves and Grindelwald only switched places in the tunnel. Maybe they had a plan, Grindelwald goes to jail publicly while Graves carries on his work in secret, gives the impression that with Grindy in jail everything is all right, so Graves work goes unhindered.
I was excited about a johnny depp performance 15 years ago. Now I am weary of him to be completely honest.
Not sure if it was directly hinted, but Rowling did say that it was not a coincidence that WWII and the Elder Wand fight both ended in 1945.
I doubt they're gonna go there, to be honest. The franchise is too big and they're playing it too safe.
They did that already. I'm pretty sure in the 6th or 7th movie. 
CGI in trailers is often unfinished, so hopefully the details will be better upon release. I remember thinking the effects in Jurassic World looked low-budget in it's trailers, but the finished product was pretty great. 
hopefully just not finished
Whats with Black Panthers and bad CG?
really feel like the "fantastic beasts" tag is out of place after the first one.


they could've done something kind of like star wars, where they're all subtitled "a wizarding world production" or something. 
6 Fantastic Beasts movies?
The first one seems to be an introduction for the real story which is the war against Grindelwald. This one is going right in.
Definitely, I'm hyped to see Grindelwald in action, and younger Dumbledore and how he'll eventually beat his old friend and win the Elder Wand.
JK Rowling Presents Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of ~~Magneto~~ Grindelwald.

Honestly, the goofy look is perfectly in character for someone like Grindelwald. He's an egotistical narcissist and a maniac, and someone like him really wouldn't notice or even care that his appearance is so strange and offputting to normal people. On people without any real power it looks goofy, but on someone like Grindelwald it's terrifying. 
"Out of the shadows and into the Light! ^^^Hail ^^^Hydra!"
He even looks sort of Hitler-esque, except with white hair.
I think they're being judgemental because Colin Farrell was fucking awesome as Graves, and Depp is almost too big a character to portray Grindelwald without thinking "Hey that's Johnny Depp" every 5 minutes. 

Along with how Depp has been coasting through performances for paychecks, I can see why people are being judgy. That being said I hope he nails it because I'm so excited with the direction they're deciding to take this series, and my gut tells me that Depp is going to kill it. 
He’s great obviously, but I think Mads Mikkelsen will be better as Grindelwald.
[deleted]
I know I'll be watching it even if he isn't as good as Colin Farrell. I still wish Colin Farrell was acting, since there was this sinister presence about him.
Molly's mother maybe?
It makes complete sense to me.  Dumbledore always sees the best in people and gives them a chance to realize that.  He loved him as a teen because they were both brilliant.   It was the first time Dumbledore connected with a peer his age.  

It completely makes sense that Dumbledore may have felt that Grindelwald loved him back even for a second.  So Dumbledore sees this person who understood him on a level no one else had before, that he may feel has the capacity to love.  He would definitely fight for that considering Dumbledore's history with second chances.  

He may also understand why Grindelwald feels the draw to power the way he did.   Dumbledore himself said "He could not trust himself with power" which is why he never accepted the role as minister.  He may be trying to save Grindelwald from himself because he understands him. 
They also had their one-sided love affair when they were both 17-20 years old, so [this](https://thechatterjis.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/johnny-depp.jpg?w=768&h=1145) is the Grindelwald Dumbledore fell for. 
I get it. He's the dark, brooding bad boy. 

Edit: I'd tap that heterochromatic bastard. 
Because you're seeing the war criminal Grindelwald, not the passionate, charismatic 19-year-old that Dumbledore befriended.
I mean they hung out when they were like 19 years old for a summer.

Probably looked different at the time.
He's attracted to power which they both share. Not everyone is infatuated by physical appearances. At least it's what I think in Dumbledore's case.
u do know the only reason isis is a thing is becouse steve irwin is no longer here to stop them

Yeah I think a theory right now is that he was defense against the dark arts teacher until after the Grindelwald conflict, where he decides to switch to a different subject due to what happened. 
No,thats just what happens with Riddikulus 
But he does make a good point that they are in the Defense against the dark arts classroom rather than the transfiguration one.

I suppose because it’s a bigger room. 
Unless you're in a hotter climate than it's out of style pretty quickly.
It certainly did, but a lot of fans take issue with the wizards not looking like the wizards from the books (ie robes, etc). Which I can kind of understand, but the Fantastic Beasts movies are making a point of demonstrating that wizards must hide from the muggles/nomags so it makes sense thematically that they're dressed less "magically". It plays into Grindelwald's whole point about wizards not being allowed to be wizards out of fear of "inferior" beings.

Especially considering in New York City wizards are forbidden from interacting with nomags, but they have to occupy the same city with them, so not standing out is preferable.
Having him reprise as Percival Graves,  alive but battered by Grindelwald, would be good enough for me. 
Kinda like how Ghandi went from wearing suits to wearing more humble robes 
I'm asking the same thing myself, he should be doing Transfiguration. Perhaps the film will address it?
I was thinking because of the transfiguration nature of the counter spell, he could be covering it. Or he is filling in for another professor.

I mean it's not out of the team of possibility that he had taught both, teachers changing subjects isn't uncommon and it's even happened in HP.
Flashback to Newt as a kid, so there’s no telling - maybe he had that job first 
That would make sense, considering that it was sort of implied at the end of the first book that it did not take much convincing for Flamel and his wife to destroy the Philosopher's Stone.
> It preserves life not youth. 

So what was his endgame? Become a skeleton or glorified Forsaken of Lordaeron?
Like...butter scraped over too much bread. 
this is the correct answer and I'm glad they went this route. He's alive but his quality of life doesn't look great. 
How much you wanna bet someone's going to 'die' and Nicholas Flamel's going to be like "no worries, I got you"
[deleted]
I can't wait either. How often do we get pure magic movies that are aimed at the older set and are not horror movies? There are no teenager or kid characters. (Okay, except maybe for a flashback to a younger Newt.)  It's all adults doing adult things. The last movie we had like that was Doctor Strange. Before that...I don't know when. 

I think Newt is my favorite character to come out of Potterverse. He is such an atypical hero. Nurturing, quiet, shy but none the less brave and determined. He doesn't need to shout to be a hero. His whispers are strong enough. 
> American muggle

"No-maj"

(Speaking of stupid names...)
Should be the philosopoher's stone because that's actually a thing. The 'sorcerer's stone' is not a thing. 
I mean it's literally called the Philosophers stone. That's what JK Rowling decided to call it, that's what the mythological stone outside of Harry Potter called it. Nothing to do with purists, just Americans calling it the wrong name
I think people would prefer philosopher as that is how the stone actually is referred to here.
Was Philosopher's Stone everywhere but America though, not like it's one country versus another. 
[deleted]
IMO i think depp being grindelwald will be a good thing and people will grow into it.  i dont understand the hate he gets for this casting.
Is he a fine enough actor to overcome the ridiculous character design? It looks like it was stolen from a fanfic.
Black Mass was meant to be pretty great wasn't it, his performance anyway
I was so disappointed when Colin Farrell turned out to be Johnny Depp.
Bcos the mirror was enchanted by dumbledore so that whoever wants the stone, but not use it, will get it.

I am sure that after the spell has been lifted harry would have again seen his parents.
Oh my god this is a great reading. Blew my mind. Or, maybe the mirror would show what he most wished: that he had not killed Ariana. 
Would it be the answer to his question or the answer that he wants to see the most? 

Wouldn't the mirror show him that Grindelwald killed his sister because his greatest fear is that he himself killed her?
Hmm wasnt dumbledore also in a romantic relationship with grindelwald? I rook it as the mirror showing dumbledores love for grindelwald.
But that seems to be saying the opposite. He didn't want to know. I think the mirror probably just showed his sister. Just like it showed Harry his parents.
Maybe it starts with his Sister and the rest of the family, and then darkness slowly creeps across it and blots them out until Grindelwald appears.
He wants the W.
[its a very dangerous mirror](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FQTZoH8y.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fgallery%2Fyyhsy&docid=H1bE0_waRCZiuM&tbnid=3iYaBHYORVn2dM%3A&vet=1&w=1280&h=1804&hl=en-us&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)
Dumbledore never actually saw socks, he just told Harry he did.
maybe himself as the version that didn't get a wake up call then and continued to pursue the hallows? 
[its very dangerous mirror](https://i.imgur.com/QTZoH8y.jpg)
I've found a lot of people aren't aware of that, which shocked me at first but then I remembered most people probably just read the books and watched the movies, they never actually pay attention to the things Rowling has revealed afterword.

So for those that don't know: Dumbledore was gay the whole time, which is why he had no wife or children, and why he was so obsessed with Grindelwald when they were young. Not a fan theory, Rowling revealed it herself.
Anyone that's fallen in love with someone who used that one-sided love to their advantage is really going to feel for poor Dumbledore in these movies :(

e: I mean honestly, [this shot of Dumbledore almost shamefully staring into the Mirror of Erised and seeing Grindelwald](https://i.imgur.com/gPd5gN6_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) is like something you'd see as a fan painting. It's so good. 
That’s not it. He was afraid that Grindelwald would tell him that it was dumbledores spell that killed his sister. Dumbledore, abaforth and Grindelwald were all 3 dueling and dumbledore said he didn’t know which of their spells hit her.

He waited so long until he couldn’t put off facing him any longer.
I think the main reason he waited is because he didn't want to know who between Grindelwald and him killed his sister. I'm sure his friendship/love for Grindelwald played a part though.
This also made me less mad at him for "sacrificing" Harry to kill Voldemort . He puts the greater good over his own feelings and him defeating Grindelwald proves that to me
[https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a48884/jk-rowling-dumbledore-in-love-with-grindelwald/](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a48884/jk-rowling-dumbledore-in-love-with-grindelwald/)
Ah fuck
I wonder if they had it tattooed on their bodies like 80% of teenagers nowadays.
And they made it a point in the script that he dropped his wand before she summoned the wand. 
Yeah but you don’t have to hold the elder wand to lose it. Aka Malfoy. Harry took Malfoys wand and with it the elder wand was loyal to Harry
Maybe I missed it, but since PoA the costumes are mostly Muggle clothes right? 
Ah, so the Targaryen route then.
They definitely do, but I'm digging the design. There's still a lot of time for the CGI to be polished
Sort of feels like they're supposed to look like that to me. Like they cam right out of some Egyptian art.
Agreed, though I felt that way with quite a bit of the trailer. They still probably have some work to do.
Yeah, went back to look, and the hair and performance definitely fooled me.
I knew he had that twinkle ever sense he voiced Lemony Snicket. One of the few highlights of the Series of Unfortunate Events movie.
Honestly over the past 15 years Jude Law for me has turned from "ugh him" to "oh fuck ye he's in this". He's proved himself to work REALLY well within certain roles. I hope he brings the needed multidimensionality to Dumbledore (because, let's face it, old Albus is a scheming sociopath on a good day, while still being a philanthropic nice old man). 
Not to mention he probably taught there for a very long time. Perhaps when he first started he was DADA, and then when the Transfiguration opened up he took it.
Yeah but as we read/see in prisonner of Azkaban, Riddikulus is taught by Defense Against The Dark Art teachers like Lupin. Dumbledore is a transfiguration teacher.
What if you’re  in the closet and you fear being exposed? Your secret will literally come out of the closet.
until someone's greatest fear is really serious, like an abusive parent 
yup, there's a scene in OOTP where a boggart in grimauld place seems to get confused between molly weasley and sirius. and lupin mentions it in the lesson, iirc. to quote the hp wiki:   


>When facing a boggart, it is best to have someone else along, to try to confuse it, since facing more than one person at once would make it indecisive as to what form it must take, usually a mixed-up amalgam of the victims' fears 
I mean, if you look super closely near the end of the first film, you see a wisp of Credence's Obscurus form leaving the subway. Pretty much meant he would probably eventually rematerialize
But one of the last scenes of the movie was Jacob remembering the magical animals and Queenie visiting his bakery 
Swooping Evil venom only takes away the bad memories. Most of Jacob's time spent with wizards have been positive.
The light actually rushes from it's source to be contained within it and you can release it later, so if you can do that mechanically, I missed a lesson at tech school. 
Isn't it called that at the beginning of the first book, too?
Shame on me, As it’s mentioned more being called Deluminator that’s what I’ve always called it, In my head when I thought that is was me being young and calling it by a sillier name.
I actually associate that sound with The Phantom Menace; that scene with the slave kids all hanging out by Anakin's podracer. All like 10 year olds.
> You are less stupid than others.  
 
some refer to this as “brighter”



That high-pitched burst of laughter he gave when he saw Newt climb into the suitcase for the first time was one of my favorite moments of the last movie.
Harry and Jacob are what's termed the "audience surrogate" - the person from "our world" (or at least a version of our world closer to the one they're about to encounter) to whom everything needs explaining to, which in turn allows the author to explain it to us.

Warning: [TV Tropes link](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceSurrogate)
I was under the impression that Grindelwald took some of Grave's hair and just impersonated him using Polyjuice potion, maybe keeping him locked up in Nurmenguard or something.

Didn't think they were allies, or did I miss something?
Yes a scene with Grindlewald meating Hitler would be too much
The orphanage scene, yeah, but if the new movies span that timeline it would be weird to leave it out of these ones, I think.
[deleted]
I think as long as Newt stays in the story, they're gonna stick with fantastic beasts name tag.
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald: A Wizarding World Production: A JK Rowling Joint
5 - https://mobile.twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/786672876904706048
Kinda like the Pirates of the Caribbean movies then. First movie relatively standalone and then the other two ish sequels will be tied together.
Fassbender as Grindelwald would’ve been a home run
Almost every fantasy/sci-fi story does some version of professor x and magneto. It's really cliche at this point
It's a show of what he is. He's the kind of narcissist to believe he has to flex his power even in his appearance. 
And it works because it makes him stand out for an ordinary wizard. 
Put your hands down u/Worthyness , you look like a West Texas cheerleader at a pep rally
I also think there's some ill will towards him because of his domestic abuse as well
Depp can pull it out when he wants to. I hope they get the performance they need out of him
I’m giving them credit for hiding Depp being Grindelwald in the first movie and making it a surprise. They used his fame as a communication device, by casting a big timer for the role and dropping him at the last minute, they showed THIS GUY is the real antagonist without needing any exposition. 

They could have made him major in that movie and marketed on him but they showed they cared more about the long-game buildup and took the more humble move. I’m excited where they’re going to take it and the writers have my trust that they care about quality. 
Hoping it's similar to Bruce Willis in Glass, where it seems like a project he is interested in and is passionate about and (hopefully) will bring Pirates 1 Depp instead of On Stranger Tides Depp... *shudders*
God I hope we get Graves back. Colin Farrell was fantastic and I was so disappointed when he was revealed to be Grindelwald. Not because of Johnny Depp etc. but because it meant we got less Colin Farrell.
I would love to see Mads in this role.
The accent would be a huge plus (even if it's a wrong one). Grindelwald must've really love USA to develop an American accent
It's more likely to be Arthur's mother, as then her name can be Weasley and the audience can say "that's a name I recognise!"
Also correct me if I'm wrong but didn't his love of grindelwald lead him to want to also be a wizard Hitler? Or am I making that up because I swear in deathly hallows they mention that Dumbledore also believed the same shit to an extent 
The books have mentioned that Grindelwald was very handsome in his early days, not unlike Voldemort actually. Physical attractiveness alongside charisma can make a deadly combination.

Johnny Depp was considered a heartthrob back in the 80's/90's so it's not completely out of left field.
Except everyone would want Defense Against the Dark Arts to be taught by the man who brought down the greatest Dark wizard in history (up to that point).
I mean... obviously.
Ah yes, the Mad Eye Moody route. I'm down for that.
He most likely is a substitute teacher
I'm willing to bet there'll be some explanation, but the real reason is the bit about working in an office. They probably just wanted that character building moment in there.
He was a teacher for 40 years before we know for sure he taught Transfiguration (when McGonagall was in Hogwarts), there would have been plenty of time for a subject change. 
This lesson was like 80 years or something before Harry starts attending Hogwarts. In that time the curriculum has definitely changed a lot and it would not be weird for Riddikulus to be moved to DADA, since it could be covered by either subject. 
>UNTIL McGonagall was hired (no clue about her age could have also not even been born yet) and then switched to DADA for a while or subbed.

Time to crack my Pottermore knuckles. McG was born in 1935 and started working at Hogwarts as a Transfiguration teacher in 1956. She was taught by Dumbledore in Transfiguration during her school years, which would have been 1947 until 1954. Crimes of Grindelwald is set in what, 1927? I don't think we ever got a year for Dumbledore starting to teach, but it must have been somewhere in the 1900s or 1910s if he taught Newt, since Newt was at Hogwarts from 1908 onwards (he didn't finish so he must have left before 1915). Dumbledore was born in 1881 and iirc the whole Ariana drama went down in 1899.

 So he could have started at any point after that, we know from McGonagall that they start the teachers young. But even if he started in say, 1905, that would leave us with over 40 years until McG arrives and we know for sure he teaches Transfiguration. Plenty of time for a subject change or two (which to me would even make sense if your goal at some point is to be head teacher. and if we consider that he was supposedly already the most brilliant student around when he himself was at hogwarts, why not? 
I'm pretty sure McGonagall was mentioned to be standing when Hagrid was expelled because of Tom Riddle (as seen in the flashback that Riddle's diary shows, I can be mistaken though), and that Dippet was the Headmaster, with Dumbledore being the Transfiguration professor.
"I'm too old for this shit"
Well he ended up just letting himself and his wife die after the first HP, maybe he just had some stuff he really wanted to finish before moving on to the afterlife?
He'd have the greatest casting animations in the HP universe then. 
The philosopher stone is the magnum opus of alchemy. It's the search for the knowledge more so than immortality.
I wish the philosophers stone had never come to me...
This line is permanently in my meta. Whenever I make toast I think of this line. Then I always think "Oh I thought of that line again", and then "Oh I acknowledged that I always think of that line again" and so on.
Not a best moment for him. 50-60 more years and he could have used muggles' senescence reversal therapies.
There is a theory the Stone was used as a bait for Voldemort and for Harry to be tested by Dumbledore. Hence the the rest of the protections and Dumbledore allowing Harry to go stop him even though there was no way Voldemort would have been able to get stone out of the mirror the way it worked. The fact fact Dumbledore in the end of the first book spoke to Harry and how Harry though he was let to try this and how in the 7th book in Prince’s Tail Dumbledore told Snape to watch after Quirrell early in the year supports this. 

But while most Harry Potter theories are great and make perfect sense this could be more like attemp to make Rowling’s story form the first book that was more for kids more interesting and fix some plot holes.
> How often do we get pure magic movies that are aimed at the older set and are not horror movies? 

They are extremely rare.

It seems like the Fantastic Beasts movies are for the people that grew up reading the Harry Potter books and now those people are adults.

I think it's great that we finally have movies that are "magic for adults."

If you haven’t already, check out Stardust!

(Which is 11 years old. Doesn’t feel that old!)
You should check out the TV show The Magicians. If you're not already watching it, it's probably right up your alley. 
I thought that was a poor idea considering Americans have been calling them muggles since the first book came out. It just seems wrong and it doesn't make sense really. I can understand the American magical community doing something different but that's something that doesn't resonate with American audiences.
So is "Muggle" though?  We're just more familiar with it at this point.   No-maj makes more sense honestly.
It's also what the stone from legend is actually called. People seem to forget that the philosopher's stone was a thing long before Harry Potter.
I think the hate is because he puts too much Jack Sparrow into a lot of his characters in the last 10 years. The way he did Jack was brilliant, one of the best characters in all movies, but then it seemed that every character he did after that had just so much of Jack that it takes you out of the movie.

He and the writers/directors can whip up a wholely new original character with its own cadences and ticks then I think Johnny Depp is a great pick. 
For me, Collin Ferrel was an awesome choice. We’ll see how this goes though of course.
Most of the hate has nothing to do with his acting, it's due to the things he does IRL.
Is *Johnny Depp* good at playing a role despite its flamboyant and eccentric character design? 
He was great there. No Jack Sparrow anywhere. 
That always seemed to unnecessary to me. They could've have revealed in any number of other ways, but I disliked the way they did it. Maybe I just wanted them to keep Colin Farrel. 
Harry saw himself with a family, not just his parents. ~~Also Rowling has said that epilogue Harry would look into it and only see his reflection because he now has everything he wants. This seems to indicated that the mirror's reflection (and people's deepest desires) can change over time.~~

edit: I can't find the quote from Rowling about Harry so I may have mistaken a fan theory for a quote from her. My bad guys.
People’s desires change over time

Younger Dumbledore sees his friend / crush who he’s too afraid to face, who is also beginning a rampage of terror, thus is prominent in his mind

Older Dumbledore sees his biggest regret: his little sister

Is that really so damn hard to comprehend?!
I think this is why Dumbledore understood the fascination. You weren’t seeing truth, you were seeing desire and hope. Dumbledore likely wondered quite a bit on whether or not what he saw was true. 
Yeah, he would probably want to see that he and Aberforth weren't the ones who killed their sister.
> It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts... However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth.

I would generally presume Dumbledore to know that when viewing the mirror. 
Or he sees Grindlewald because above all else he wants to see he wasn't the one who killed his sister and the mirror shows him the one who killed his sister (because Albus would have wanted it to be Grindlewald).
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Dumblewhore confirmed 
God, I love these comics.

I just realized why Dumbledore believes so strongly in the power of love: He knows what it's like to have it used against you.
I HOPE they show that scene
It’s not teenagers it’s mostly people in their mid to late twenties because they grew up with the books.
Exactly!! I was so relieved when there was no plothole because of this
Right but if he had it he would have been using it. He just hadn't gotten at that point yet
Avada Dracarys!
They kinda looked Egyptian-y, right?
That and Billy Connolly 
I fucking love Jude Law. He is a good Watson to Downey's Holmes too. 
It could be that it's normally taught in transfiguration, but because Lupin was rather focused on dark creatures, he asked permission to teach the lesson from Mcgonagall.  Plus he mostly taught it because they found a bogart in the staff room, so it could have just been a right place right time kind of thing, and  I can definitely see the overlap between transfiguration and defense against the dark arts in the case of boggarts!
Sometimes physics teachers have to teach a little math. Sometimes math teachers use physics to illustrate a practical application to a mathematical principle. 

I feel like riddikulus is a transfiguration spell with a practical application in DATDA. A teacher of either subject would have reason to teach it. Likewise, if transfiguration isn't the DATADA teacher's specialty, the transfiguration teacher could be brought in to handle that lesson. 
Or being naked in front of a whole class... 
We technically saw something similar. When Neville's Bogart turned into Snape, who was incredibly abusive to the boy. 
Or an abusive teacher.....oh wait 
Point taken, though in that example, it's probably best it's revealed in front of a teacher. Your classmates knowing about it isn't great, but *someone* knowing about it is.
That same scene also shows how powerful boggarts can be when faced alone.  That boggart basically reduced Molly to a blubbering mess before she was found.
There was also a deleted scene of him getting on the same boat as Newt. 
[deleted]
Jacob's laughter is always amazing. 

Personally, I loved when he drank the gigglewater. The sound of it was so unexpected that it startled a laugh out of me that sounded just like his. XD
It wasn’t polyjuice, it was transfiguration. I just suggested a retcon.
>meating
And I think Newt's inclusion is supremely important.  He is the Harry Potteresqe Audience Surrogate.  If you got rid of him and just had Dumbledore, it wouldnt be anywhere near as good.

Also, Newt Scamander as a cinematic example of a low-key yet competant hero (versus just about every other version of a hero in movies) is important.  Almost as important as Luke Skywalker winning ROTJ with pacifism.

Needless to say, I am super excited to see where Rowling takes us with this story.  I think it is important in a time of rising facism.
God damn I thought this was going to be a trilogy. A pleasant surprise 
I hope they will not decline in quality like PotC, The Curse of the Black Pearl is the best one.
He's a home run in anything he does though.
Yeah, I can’t look past that. And to see studios and even JKR herself backing him up is just disappointing. 
> I hope ~~they~~ ~~get~~ he gives the performance they need out of him

It's up to him. He'll either phone it in with "Ok guess I've gotta play a bad guy here..." or he'll realize the importance the character holds to so many people and he'll absolutely throw himself into it like he did with Jack Sparrow. There will be no in-between. 

He wrote letters back to Grindelwald that sort of implied they were on the same page to an extent but the death of Ariana caused the rift.  Here is his original letter to G that you are thinking of:

"Gellert -

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES' OWN GOOD - this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.)

Albus"
Also this is before Voldemort supposedly cursed the job of DADA teacher. 
That's what I think too. He taught for decades at Hogwarts anyway, it's not unlikely he took more teaching positions than just one.
Yep.  "Prof. Merrythought is sick today for plot-related reasons, I'll be your teacher for this lesson.  Ignore the cameras."
Even if it weren't in DADA, it would have been in Charms rather than Transfiguration.
we actually know the DADA teacher of that time. It's Prof. Galatea Merrythought. She taught DADA from 1895 till 1945. So if Rowling keeps the established timeline, a substitute situation would probably be the most logical explanation - and a very simple one.
This guy potters.
But not a day over 375
he was a super brilliant alchemist from what we know, maybe the two of them just wanted to continue their research. 
Yeah. The pearl of immorality (China) and the Philosopher’s Stone (the West) are metaphors for enlightenment. Or are they only metaphors...?
So do all who live to see such times...
How times change, where muggles are coming closer and closer to technology that surpasses magic itself.

I still wonder how wizards would view nuclear bombs. I don't think it was ever addressed in the books or movies.
There is another evidence - when Voldemort realized he couldn't touch Harry, in Goblet of Fire, he uses Harry's blood to come back to life.

When Dumbledore hears this, he has a "victorious / satisfied" look on his face, which Harry notices and finds strange.

Voldemort using Harry's blood eventually acted against him in 7th book and kept Harry alive despite being hit by the killing curse.
Because those are Americans reading a British book saying muggles. This is a contemporary series with American slang. It's no different than any other American/British slang differences. The complaints are silly. 
They don't forget, they just don't know from the beginning. 
I would have been totally fine if Colin Farrell turned out to be Grindelwald played by Colin Farrell
Well obviously. Remember what Ron saw? Quiddich cup and all that? He archieved that mostly, so it had to change afterwards. 
That...wow yeah I'm gonna steal that one. That's a mindfuck
DuMbLeDoRe ShOt FiRsT
I fully expect we will see it, just not in this film. We've still got three more to after this!

Reminded me a bit of [Displacer Beasts](https://orig00.deviantart.net/0595/f/2016/111/9/d/displacer_beast_by_almega_3-d9zqwxs.png)
Oh totally! That was my one disappointment about the show. The movie nailed Uncle Monty perfectly.
absolutely loved him as Pitch, too.
and it would become your greatest fear as soon as you realized it was a possibility lol
That is still *a lot* of trust to put into someone. Also crowds of pre-teens/teens aren't really the groups you'd want knowing your greatest fears at any point in life.
It should have killed him like 10 years before. He's the only one to have gotten that old with it, so it doesn't seem so crazy that he has more power to control it. 
I love love love Newt, the socially awkward Hufflepuff, being the main male character. He's such a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of male leads in blockbuster movies.
[deleted]
> He's a home run in anything he does though.

He's a home run in his performance but the projects are mostly shit. Even X Men has gone into a bit of trouble, which sucks because he's amazing. 
If it had come out recently then I could get it, but he filmed the role while known to be an abuser. I also can't get past it, it's the most reprehensible of reprehensible behaviour
Yeah I remembered that because it was so odd. I know that whole segment of the book (irl and in his biography) was to show Dumbledores flaws but it seemed a bit out of character until you realize how close he and the grind were. 

I'm like 97% sure that they will sort of recon it/explain it and say that albums wasn't actually wanting to be wizard Hitler but he loved grindelwald so much he'd so anything. Because I'm pretty sure without the knowledge of how close he and grindelwald were it seems like Dumbledore was all for it to an extent until his sister was killed 
Voldemort cursed the job *because* Dumbledore refused to give it to him. Dumbledore was headmaster already at that time.
Tbh just because Dumbledore was mostly Transfiguration doesn't mean he always has to be that. Perhaps his change of profession could show the character progression between losing his good friend Grindlewald.
wait, did they ever say in the books that Voldemort cursed it? I remember at one point someone points out to Harry that the position is probably cursed, using past teachers as example. I dont recall it ever being mentioned that Voldemort might have cursed it.
The curse of having more than one certification... he probably picked up DADA to strengthen his resume when he applied for the transfig opening, not expecting that admin would *actually make him teach it*. The worst...
Could be in all three honestly. 
ah goddamn i forgot about her, she was mentioned in half blood prince, right? but yeah then substitute makes sense!

i've always wondered how the teacher system works anyway. pottermore mentions mcgonagall was recruited by dumbledore when he was "department head". which makes it seem like there's either multiple teachers teaching/researching the same subject (which is weird since we never got an inclanation of either multiple positions or research happening, though i guess if hogwarts had more students back then?) OR certain subjects being brought together in one departement. but iirc he was specifically called head of the transfiguration department. it's so weird because the books never brought up any hierarchy with the teachers apart from heads of houses & headmaster, iirc. 
this girl could at one point name the 100 most mentioned characters in the books in one of those sporcle quizzes, idk if that's something to be proud of tbh. but i did have to check a few of the dates on pottermore lmao
"Who last year celebrated his 665th birthday"

I loved that line from the first movie. Clever little way of saying 666.
But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
Is that Gollum?

NEWT *throws pokeball*
 I like no-maj. Sounds exactly like what American wizards would say. Muggle doesn’t sound like anything an American would come up with to me. 
Harry: "I see my murdered parents."

Ron: "I'm Head Boy and I'm holding the Quidditch Cup! And I'm Quidditch Captain this is hype as fuck!"

Classic Ron.
Harry Potter has the same birthday as me.  I'm nearly 40.

And now that I think about it, the teachers didn't do shit about Harry's child abuse.

I love that he is even more grounded by having a muggle companion. Harry is great, but is still a golden boy prophecy.

He is the young kid reader growing up and realizing that even those everyone tells you you are amazing and great you have to confront the reality of life and actually strive to become what everyone builds you up to be.

Fantasic Beasts and Newt by association is great because it's the same type of story but for the next age of Harry Potter readers. It's basically the right age for young adults in their late teens to early 20s who have to deal with tons of different politics, ideas, philosophies, and shit and Grindelwald vs. Dumbledore can be compared to the "edgy realist" versus "emotional romanticist" and how you have to grow up and learn how to balance the romantics with the rationalism.
Alien Covenant was all-around shit show yet his performance(s) was stellar.
Yeah I was talking about his performance, though I wouldn't say "mostly shit" about the movies he's in even though he has some disappointments like Assassins Creed.
That was a hundred years in the past from the Dumbledore in the series. It's pretty believable that as a teen he was different-immature, arrogant. 

Dumbledore doesn't refute that he once believed in Grindelwald's message in DH. I'd be very surprised if they change it. 
What do you mean he "cursed" the job? I'm not familiar with this detail.
He was a teenager when they were friends, long before he started working at hogwarts. 
“Good friend” I see what you did there.
In Half Blood Prince there's a flashback to Voldemort applying for the job and meeting Dumbledore. Dumbledore basically told him to fuck off and said to Harry that ever since he rejected Voldemort for the job no teacher has been able to last longer than a year. So it's heavily implied some abstract curse rests on it due to Voldemort.
Yes, Dumbledore tells Harry this after showing him the memory of Voldemort coming to ask for a teaching job (which was also an excuse to get in the school to hide a horcrux in the room of requirement): “Oh, he definitely wanted the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. The Aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have not been able to keep a Defence Against the Dark Arts professor for more than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort." 
Yes, after Dumbledore refused him the position. It’s in HBP
But Transfiguration is the least likely because it has the least to do with it. The only real relevance there is the transforming nature of a boggart. The charm needed to make it change appearance is not like other transfiguration spells. All you need to do to make the spell cause them to be something funny to you is to think of it. There is no technical know how required like there would be if it were a transfiguration spell.

It's relevant to DADA because a boggart is a threat that may be encountered and students need to be able to recognise them and know how they tick. It's relevant to charms because the counter spell itself is a charm spell.
Well, it was in the book.
Also the book that she uses is old AF so he must be even older
Such a beautiful quote...
Exactly, damnit. 
That was actually a kinda important character moment. He wasn't just Quidditch Captain, he was also Head Boy. For a kid who's the second youngest of 7, having those things that make him stand out was very important for him. 
What was he supposed to see? His whole family was alive then. It's kind of charming that he was so content the only thing he really wanted was the Quidditch Cup.
i mean in a way it's quite tragic? he saw himself as standing out for once since he's otherwise the "unremarkable" one of his siblings. there's a great post somewhere that actually goes into how in the end he overtook his siblings in their specific disciplines (curse breaking with destroying a horcrux, freeing the dragon etc etc), which i always found quite a nice resolution for his arc. 
Happy almost birthday!

I think being a lestrange helps a bit. I would assume they're a fairly powerful wizarding family.
Yeah, had that entire movie been about his character it could very easily have ended up being one of my favorites in the series.
No teacher can hold the job for more than a year
First year was Quirrell, second year was Lockhart (twat), then Lupin, then Moody (mad eye), then that bitch Umbridge, sixth year was Snape (which was the job he always wanted), then Carrow. Riddle cursed the job. 
It's mentioned in The Half Blood Prince book. Dumbledore shows Harry, Tom Riddle's memories throughout his sessions in the book. One of those memories was the last memory of Tom Riddle (just before he became The Dark Lord and the war that ensued). In that memory, Tom Riddle visits Dumbledore and applies for the DADA professor post. Now, his appearance here is note-worthy: His eyes have a hint of the red colour his eyes have later on, his skin is white (signifying he has split his soul). Dumbledore declines to make him the professor. Tom, angrily then proceeds on to go to the Room of Requirement to hide Ravenclaw's Diadem.

It is then that he cursed the position. Now, we don't know what happened to the professors before Harry joined (and I don't remember if Quirrel had joined the position that year or was teaching before that year), but yes after Harry joined, in his 6 years at Hogwarts every single DADA professor didn't last for more than a year. 
Tom Riddle wanted the DADA teaching position so much he decided if he couldnt have it no one could, so ever since no teacher who has taught DADA has ever made it past 1 school year.
I cry every time 
>also Head Boy

Better off without it. You'll turn into a little Quisling bitch

And head boy. Basically he wanted to stand out. He probably didn't get much attention growing up the 6th of 7,especially with the first and only girl right behind him. 
The funny thing Is, this must have gone on for decades.
It wasn't ever *really* Moody who taught the class though. It should be Barty Crouch Jr on the list. 
Quirrel was returning from a sabbatical in Albania during Harry’s first year. It’s where he picked Voldemort up. Now I don’t know what he taught before then but he had been a Hogwarts teacher previously. 
Ahhhh, I only read up to the Order of the Phoenix so I didn't catch that. They never touch on any of that in the movies. Personally, I feel like they should make Harry Potter into a mini series type thing (one season for each school year) so they can touch on a lot more of the details that they missed in the movies.
Well, can we assume that curse was broken when Voldy kicked it?
