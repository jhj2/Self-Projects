Thoughts on the movie aside.

That was a fucking fantastically well edited trailer, especially for fans of the first two films. 

Like I don’t enjoy the movies much but it kind of made me really want to see a final chapter that I never knew I’d kind of been looking forward to. 

Bravo. 
We all know this movie will kill with the average Reddit user...
