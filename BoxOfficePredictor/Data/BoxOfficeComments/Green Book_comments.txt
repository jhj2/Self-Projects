Peter Farrelly, of the Farrelly brothers, directed this. 
That was much lighter than I thought it would be. It’s fun seeing Viggo play this role, it’s very much against type yet he’s still nailing it. Mahershala, of course, is always a welcome sight in anything.
[removed]
Always love seeing Viggo. He's one of the best
Man, Ali is such a brilliant actor and Viggo as well - this looks absolutely outstanding.
I love a good road trip movie, especially with Viggo and Mahershala in it. 
Don Shirley was such a fantastic pianist and criminally under appreciated. Hopefully this movie introduces him to a larger audience.    
Good God does Viggo have some range

I had no idea it was him until the trailer announced it.

I love the chemistry between the 2 leads, Mahershala's cultured yet beleaguered pianist against Viggo's humorous yet frustrated driver
Looks really fun
Both these boys showing some range
This looks really wonderful. I love roadtrip movies and I love their chemistry already. 
First 20 seconds or so I could only see the Russian driver from Eastern Promises - by the end of it I saw a Jersey-Italian driver. Good stuff from Viggo.

Look forward to seeing this one.
This has oscar written all over it
[deleted]
Mahershala Ali is such a striking person. Reminds me of someone like Tilda Swinton. Just so many nice angles.
Oh yeah. My parents will love this.

I am also quite keen to see it. 
Looks great.
Shout-out my man Arwin from the Suite Life of Zack and Cody showing up in this
This looks really fucking good.
It's crazy how wasted Mahershala Ali was on House of Cards. He's truly a first class actor, but his character on that show was so one note. Everything he has done since has been brilliant. 
Excited to catch this at TIFF in a few weeks
Great Original Premise. Not some Oscar Bait.

Awesome to see Both Characters learning something from each other.

CAN'T WAIT!
The chemistry is off the carts just in this trailer. Very good vibes.
This looks great! The opposite Driving Mrs Daisy 
Guess I’m gonna be there day one, then. 
Mahershala is such a badass name 
Is the song at the start the same one used in the Baby Driver trailer? I was going crazy wondering why the beginning of the trailer seemed so familiar
Everyone thinking it's going to be True Detective S04, but then it's a lighter tone film directed by the guy who brought us: Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Stuck to You, Shallow Hall, Osmosis Jones, and others. 
I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna cry, and I'm sure as hell watching this!
Don of Gondor
Love the castings, great trailer as well, looks like a lot of fun. 
Honest to goodness goosebumps. Lve me a real film, we need more of this.
the trailer is a little cheesy with the sam smith song but I think the movie itself is gonna be great 
That actually looks really good, can't wait.
This looks fantastic. Viggo and Mahershala is a combo I never knew I needed until now.
Looks great 
Yeah, this needs to be seen for sure. Added to my list.
That was a really, really well-made trailer.
This looks motherfucking faaantastic. I am stoked. 
God dammit now I want some fucking chicken. 

Product placement is a bitch.
Why do I really want to see Gandolfini (RIP) in the Tony role instead?
Seems pretty wholesome and good spirited. I usually don't see a lot of movies like this in theater, but I'll probably make an exception for this.
I'm gonna watch the living shit out of this movie. This looks delightful and meaningful, too. 
This looks amazing. Did anyone else catch glimpses of Gandolfini in Viggo's portrayal here? 
Holy shit, this looks *electric.* And from Peter Farrelly?? Unexpected on several levels. I'm definitely watching this.
The Academy will eat this up.
Guess I'm the only one who was a bit underwhelmed with this. Looks a bit by the numbers and cliche. Was expecting a lot more from Viggo and Ali, especially since Viggo is so selective with projects. Still going to see it based on the talent alone, though, hope it was just the way they are trying to sell the movie with the trailer.
yooo that looks great! going on my list.
Sam Smith - The Thrill of it All playing at the end, is not the album version, anyone know what version it is ?
Ah, after seeing Viggo in [Captain Fantastic](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3553976/), I'm really looking forward to this. 
WOW!
Love it. Can't wait.
This looks good. Great actors and doesn't look as depressing as I expected it to be.
Aragon really loved it when KFC came to Middle Earth. 
This looks great,  can't wait to see Ali in True Detective season 3 I wish Viggo was co starring but I'll take Dorff
This looks nothing like any Farrelly Bros movie (together or separate) I've ever seen before. And probably the best leads any of them have ever had in their life.

Never heard of the two writers who is helped Peter Farrelly but this feels very subdued. I'm cautiously optimistic about this one.
This looks surprisingly really good.
It's the 1960's. He made him pick up litter.
Love a good road trip film and this looks like it has potential.
Thanks for reminding me how Summer is always empty of good movies.
What’s name of the song in the second half of the trailer ?
Driving Miss Daisy: Reverse Edition
Not only does this look really good, but it also doesn't have that annoying 5 second preview before the trailer. I'm looking forward to this one.
This gon be movie of duh yuehr
looks very good
anybody know what that wonderful 7/8 jazz piece is playing at the start of the trailer is? 
Driving Mr. Daisy?
What true story is this based on?
Man Ali is usually great in everything he touches but he seems so... wooden in this trailer. Maybe that’s just the trailer who knows 
Good to know, thanks! I guess I’ll go to youtube for a good playlist then.

then there’s this thing called vinyl and i’m a sucker for old jazz records. Looks like a good reason to fix that old belt on the pickup.
Damn, that looks good!
I love it when a movie that wasn’t in your radar pops up and now you’re hyped for it. This is that movie. 
Hey guys I know it may be a little unscrupulous to ask but is there anywhere I would be able to watch this online? I am currently in South Korea and this movie isn't opening here but I'm dying to see it. Any help is appreciated 
I appreciate that they shot this digitally. That way, even though you know it's set in the 1960's, it has that distinctive synthetic *feel* that only an Arri Alexa can provide, letting you know it was shot in 2018. 
I'm excited that mainstream America will be shown this aspect of its history.
Finally someone in Hollywood makes a movie set in this era that’s not utterly depressing and full of hate. I will gladly pay money to support this project.
Oscar bait trailer of the year
I never realized the South was so racist, wow!
Damn I was hoping this would be a Qaddafi biopic.
I really need to see more Vijo Morgenstein movies
I don't know if that tone and that cast is what a serious subject matter like this deserves.
Nothing against the actors, i'm sure this will be a good movie.

But, holy crap Hollywood. Enough of the race peddling bullshit you fake ass fraudulent liars. The film industry doesn't give a shit about ending racism. They make a fortune by selling this 'anti-racist' blaxploitation to young white consumers who grow up not realizing that Hollywood does this stuff constantly.
[deleted]
Who comes up with these titles?
I genuinely think that bodes well for this; Dumb and Dumber is a great road trip movie
Would not have expected that, but how good the comedy moments were makes sense knowing one of them is behind it
waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
The guy that directed Step Brothers is now an Academy Award winner
This really feels like an Oscar-friendly Dumb and Dumber.
yeah this is what i find most interesting. i mean, both of them are such good directors; Dumb and Dumber, Hall Pass, Kingpin, among so many other classic comedies, but this is his first solo venture and also looks way more dramatic. looks like it has the typical Farrelly bros road trip in a car comedy scenes though. 
this sub always ignores behind the camera talent and focuses always on the actors. i don’t get it. 
hope there's a scene where Viggo has earth shattering diarrhea like the scene in Dumb & Dumber. Then when he's nominated for an Oscar they can play that clip.
Truthfully, I don't think Viggo has "a type", and has had an eclectic roster of characters. He was a warrior king in LOTR, an undercover Russian FSB agent in Eastern Promises, an off-the-grid father in Mr. Fantastic, a post apocalyptic survivor in The Road. I mean hell he was Sigmund Freud in A Dangerous Method. He's got range.  
Yeah this looks really funny. There's obviously going to be some scenes of some real darkness since they're obviously going to experience a lot of racism. But it looks like it'll be able to balance both of those tones. I'm excited for this!
It's written and directed by one of the Farrelly brothers. Like the *Dumb and Dumber, Something About Mary, *Movie 43* Farrelly brothers. So makes sense that it's more comedic than you'd think just hearing the log line. Quite a departure for him though. 

I was expecting a tension filled melodrama with a tragic end. This seems more like the better version of Driving Miss Daisy with a race reversal. Very excited. 
I didn't even know that was Viggo until his name showed up.
Anyone who thinks Viggo playing comedy is "against type" has never heard stories about him from on set. I'm so happy he's been given a chance to shine, here. I was just saying the other day that I hoped he'd one day be cast in a standard comedy or a screwball. 
Throw in a full frontal shot and you have a recipe for an Oscar winner for good ole Viggo
For me his best role will always be Lalin,

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGLdIYdCq0
I wish this could've somehow tied into the Eastern Promises universe, and have that character be the choffeur, lol
Exactly. That sounds like a line my grandpa would say. He was obviously very wise. This is a “I can’t wait to see it” type of movie
I definitely need more Viggo Mortensen in my life.
It does look good and had amazing actors. But, I have to admit that I have some very serious skepticism that either one of the Farrelly brothers can write or direct a great movie in 2018.

Literally the last movie this guy wrote and/or directed that wasn't trash was there's something about Mary (1998) or arguably, me myself and Irene (2000). Either way, it's been about 20 years since this guy has been associated with anything that isn't notable garbage.

So, I'm hopeful, but it is odd.
It's like Chef but with racism
When I heard his name mentioned in the first press on this last year, I checked him out on Spotify. *Instant* fan. Everyone is talking about the plot on this, but the soundtrack has the potential to be stellar, too.
I was thinking the same. Kind of surprising a biopic hasn't been made. Dude was a genius. He's one of those people who I think will be held in higher regard in distant future years than they were closer to their own times.
Agreed. He has no real genre which creates appeal to literally everyone.  Criminally underrated as a pianist.
https://media.giphy.com/media/XOXdQszYm4I3m/giphy.gif
Let the awards flow
Yeah, definitely. It even releases in oscar season.
Hopefully for Viggo.  I'm surprised the dude hasn't won one yet.
That was my first thought too. This is oscar bait. Still looks good, might see this one in theater. 
I was gonna say that too 
oscar bait for sure
What I would give to see Viggo, Mads and Jaime Lannister in the same movie.
Screen presence for sure. I think Michael Shannon exudes it, too.
What?
Is it playing at TIFF? I've been searching for the past week and couldn't see any announcement for it.

EDIT: IT IS. SQUEE!
His full first name is Mahershalalhashbaz
Pretty sure it was used in the actual movie. "Unsquare Dance"
Which song is it?
Gondor calls for fried chicken!
I wish they'd used Don Shirley's music for the trailer. I can't wait for the film to bring his work back into the public ~~eye~~ ear.
Fun fact, Vigo's character, Tony Lip went on to play Carmine Lupertazi in the Sopranos.  He was a jack of all trades in real life. 
The character Viggo plays actually starred in the Sopranos. If anything, Gandolfini might have caught glimpses of Tony Lip.
Gandolfini with a dash of Vincent Vega 
Yep. It looks fine and will probably pay to see it but it definitely looks like a "paint by numbers oscar bait movie".
it just looks pretty flat visually. obviously Peter Farrelly was never a great stylist but ever since the Farrelly bros started shooting digital their movies started look like sitcoms. this one had a great dp, Sean Porter who shot Jeremy Saulnier's Green Room so I was kinda thinking at least it would look more cinematic since this is obviously Farrelly's shot to win some major awards.
I know Peter Farrelly is best known for comedy, but when he handles dramatic moments in his work, he handles them very well (Fever Pitch is a perfect example).
[Sam Smith - Pray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhREiAarjVY)
unsquare Dance 
The original story was written by [the real life son](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0885014/) of Viggo's character.
My guess is that's how Don Shirley was an incredibly composed and calm man in real life. He had *three* PhDs, spoke 8 languages, and was a noted performer in a time when tremendous forces were being applied to keep black men down.
Maybe thats part of the character..
To Kill A Mockingbird had some hope.
imagine seeing a great trailer featuring exceptional talent and all you come away with is some snark.
supreme trolling
The guide for safe travel for black motorists was called the green book. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz-7KcfsKd0 have you seen the Dumb & Dumber trailer recut as an Oscar bait drama
Dumb and Dumber also has some GREAT dramatic moments too. The scene where Jim Carrey exposes his lonely, vulnerable side is remarkable.
So is King Pin. I was actually getting some of those vibes from this trailer, oddly enough.
Yeah but Dumb and Dumber knew what it was. This looks like one of those racism movies that boil a complicated, deeply entrenched social issue into "loveable buffoon learns acceptance thanks to otherworldly calm black dude."
Why tho? He didn't  make a good movie since... i don't know. "Stuck on You" might be seen as not bad? Same with "Fever Pitch" ho got pretty bad after "Me, Irene and I"
Doing a Dick Cheney biopic now.
In fairness, you've got an Oscar and two nominations sitting in that car.
It's almost as if actors get the most exposure...
The actors are the ones you can see.
Yes. Everyone here ignores such anonymous directors as Wes Anderson, Christopher Nolan, Stephen Spielberg and JJAbrahms.
I do think this is the first time I’ve seen him be truly comedic, although Captain Fantastic had some good humor from him
[Don't forget that time he played Satan.](https://78.media.tumblr.com/6be211293568a8e7522b2c063161b8e9/tumblr_mno5i2rLCt1r08leoo5_250.gif)
He was both a small town dad and a former mob hitman in A History of Violence 
By type I meant that the characters he usually does are serious. He’s never done a comedic role, at least from the movies of his that I’ve seen. A person can be in a drama or a comedy but still be typecast as a serious character.
I can't remember the name of the movie right now, but he also played one of my all time favorite depictions of Lucifer.

**EDIT:** The movie is called [The Prophecy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114194/)
always saw him as just a badass
You forgot that race across the desert. That was a masterpiece 
Don't forget he was a hard nosed seal instructor in GI Jane 
His type, is whatever method act he's putting on at the time. 
I'm really hoping this is more of a Chef than anything. 
Yes, I only knew who the director was after this first trailer. When I saw the pictures posted here a few days ago with the short description, I didn’t know it was Farrelly and it looked more like a drama, considering the 2 actors involved as well.
I said against type because the majority of his characters over the years have been serious. Am I using “against type” wrong?
Speaks authentically to a subset of thinking in the times, w/ MLK and non-violent protests being a real big part of it all. Cant wait to see it as well
in that case, check out:  
Hidalgo  
Alatriste  
Loin des hommes  
Tbh I was waiting for him to play a character like this.

I mainly know him from LOTR. I LOVE seeing my action heroes in roles like these. It brings a contrast which gives you an idea about the extent of talent you’re witnessing.

The black dude looks phenomenal also. I wish I’ve known him from before. Man this is a real movie and I’ve been longing for one for some time now. Mah body is ready!
Perfect analogy. Can’t wait to see this movie. 
thanks for the laugh
I wasn't a huge fan of Chef. I hated the way he treated his son. The only way he would spend time with him is if the kid worked a full time job on his food truck then he was hard on the kid anyway.

Like, damn, he's only working that job to spend time with you. Give him a break, you arrogant ass.
I haven't laughed this hard at a comment since, who knows. Damn. 
needs food then
Wow that's really lucky for them. Really increases their chances of winning an oscar. 
Big if true 
Viggo definitely deserves it, but what I love about him as an actor is that he doesn't care about the pageantry of Hollywood, and intentionally withdrew himself from the spotlight after LOTR.
Wow. He def hasn’t has he. Crazy 
All naked, please.
Unsquare Dance. It's featured in the film and the soundtrack.
The beacons of KFC are lit!  Gondor calls for finger lickin' good chicken!
i just looked don shirley up on spotify because of this trailer, only heard a few songs so far and i am already really into his music.
Wow, I had no idea. Thanks for the tidbit.


Ever see The Trust with Nic Cage? He shot that too.
Or the hospital scene with the little girl in Shallow Hal. That was a heartbreaker.
Thanks 
Ah okay that might be it 
Could be yeah
And the general public are supposed to know that? Call it the THE Green Book at least. 
Brilliant!
I liked Hall Pass. It’s not great but it gave me quite a bit of laughs.
that’s true but i wish both sides of the camera could be noticed in this sub
all the more reason to educate yourself on behind the camera talent. you’d be surprised to see how easy it is to gauge a movie’s quality by who’s behind the camera. 
yeah, further education is needed
The scene with him drinking ~~coffee~~ mate nude is hilarious.
that nude scene in eastern promises was weirdly hilarious for me and my russian mom
There's a difference between playing a character who is funny and a funny character.  
He looooves his Cronenberg. 
You're right. Typecast doesn't mean like "is always a spy". All of those characters have a similar seriousness and intensity
Hard to make a movie like this as lighthearted and wholesome as Chef. That movie's obstacle was getting people to eat delicious food from a truck. Green Book is going up against something way worse.
No, I just always figured he had a comedy in him. Glad to see this is delivering. The man is fantastic.
Eastern Promises is not to forget.
I forgot all about Hidalgo. I love that movie. 
Alatriste is a strange and very enjoyable historical epic. Highly recommend.
> I wish I’ve known him from before

He won an Oscar in 2017!
"The black dude" has a name, it was right there in the trailer. Mahershala Ali in case you were wondering.
You should check him out in *A History of Violence*.
Both actors have a great body of work. If you like these two, there's a ton out there for you to enjoy before this movie is released. 
I need to rewatch it, but I feel like the entire point of the movie is he was arrogant and the process of the food truck with his son and friend is what transformed him into who he ultimately wanted to be.
There's KFC right there! :P
I know right! Such a coincidence that they decided to release it in the Oscar season.
[deleted]
Same. I found out about the subject while they were filming, and did some quick Googling. I was excited to see the film initially 'cause of Viggo, but I became even more excited at the thought of Don Shirley's music getting appreciated again.
nope but it looked pretty cool, should check it out
Or just Google it.... 
**THE** BLADE RUNNER

**THE** RETURN OF THE JEDI

**THE** CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND

Any time I see something that has a heavy lean or is abnormally bent, I refer to that movie.
I don't think this sub always ignores the behind the camera talent
>educate yourself

And thats the reason its not happening. Ignorance rules.
[Mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink\)), not coffee. Viggo's famously [hooked on mate](https://www.google.ca/search?q=mate+viggo+mortensen&safe=off&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=82sw9YN8ML9xXM%253A%252Cy18zr9AWEk47qM%252C_&usg=AFrqEzfxOiB8Gr3Raevpp-KuIhxTqm_4lQ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHtf-amO3cAhWFz4MKHYtiBN0Q9QEwBHoECAIQDA#imgrc=82sw9YN8ML9xXM:). (Agree about the hilarity, though!)
The nude scene in Captain Fantastic caught my family off guard. 
I get that, but we've had a million movies about intense race relations in the US. This one seems to be taking a lighter approach. While I'm aware it can't be an exact copy of Chef's style the characters could approach the problems with the same optimistic attitude that was a part of Chef. I really got a Chef vibe from those two quick clips towards the end of the trailer where Viggo is laughing in the car and Mahershala is jamming in what looks like a bar setting. We all know things were bad, but there were good people on both sides doing good things for each other. A more hopeful story in this setting would be nice, especially the way things are right now with all the different groups getting very heated and it spilling into your average home. 
Plus Chef had a really basic plot and no payoff for the actual issues Favreau's character dealt with. I'm not expecting Green Book to solve the world's racism in a 2 hour block, but I'm hoping that it won't be a simple "6 months later the world is grand" cop out like Chef had.
History of violence is not to forget.

Captain Fantastic is not to forget.

The road is not to forget.
Indeed. If I remember correct it's also spanish. So not exactly on the beaten track for blockbusters. But very good.

Loin des Hommes is based on Camus "the guest". It's a gem imo. 
I think the last oscars I gave a damn about was 2008 or something. I just lost interest I think. It’s not like I’m protesting it or anything.

I may have sentenced my interest in the art wrongfully by saying “a real movie.” I get excited when I see a real story backed by great actors and actresses AND a great overall visual quality. 

And then there’s the fact that most of the black musicians/actors I know are my favorite famous people in life. 
So sorry if I offended you. But I don’t think calling him the black dude is any different than calling Viggo the white dude. Or dude with the black tie. 

If this case was vice versa I’d call Ali by his name and Viggo by “the white dude.” Again I mean no harm and am a dude from Turkey. If I offended you somehow it would be my ignorance on the cultural importance of the matter.
Or Eastern Promises, or A Dangerous Method, or the Two Faces of January, or Jauja, or Captain Fantastic... Viggo almost always gives an amazing performance.
How tf did i miss this I’ll never know. You just made my day. Thank you!
I'm just not so sure he really learned the lesson. At the end he asks the kids if he might want to keep working on the truck.

How about baseball, Dad? Maybe some TV?
Oh trust me, I have studied that and every other Viggo naked scene *very closely*.
lol it's insane
Or don't go to see the movie because the makers are too arrogant.
Empire Strikes Back. 

Matrix. 

Force Awakens 
a lot of times it does
it’s sad 
Lol, you are correct: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*pMQ843FtKQL-OyE3yd8hYw.jpeg
I think Viggo just wants to be nude. Like that swimming scene in The Road. 
[Everybody's recommending the big stuff](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/52b0lvMK_Hg/maxresdefault.jpg) and I'm just sitting here loving [Jauja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpsyW1Dq37Q)
In fairness, I don't usually bother with the Oscars, but that was the Moonlight year with the infamous envelope-opening, and it was impossible to miss any of the news about the aftermath. :)

BTW the character Mahershala Ali plays deserves to be more famous. Give [Dr. Don Shirley's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR9d1l6oOxI) music a whirl before the movie comes out.
Check out Luke Cage, season one, on Netflix if you have access. He's the villain, and he's absolutely fantastic. One of the best things about the show.
No worries, didn't mean to come off as rude! Just wanted to make sure you knew his name because he's a great actor.
https://i.imgur.com/j3IFp.gif
A) It was 2005

B) It was a Cronenberg film

C) His acting was nuanced to the point where people keep insisting Eastern Promises was the better performance. He is *astounding* in History of Violence. Pay attention to his eyes.
The kid loved working on the truck. He was responsible for the popularity of the truck by posting online about it. Again I need to rewatch it, but I had a completely different view of it than you seem to have gotten.
It wasn't like he was like "work on this truck or I'm done with you".  He gave the child options and the truck made him happy, so they did it.  



If the kid had been like "I want to make Minecraft videos on YouTube", he would have sat down with him and helped him make videos, it was about spending time with his kid.
[deleted]
There's nothing arrogant about using a title that some people don't immediately know. 
I've read/watched dozens of interviews with him over the past year or so. It's mentioned in virtually all of them. I guess the writers use it to illustrate his methodical nature and/or weird obsessions. It does seem to be a nostalgic quirk of people who've spent time in Argentina - I have a good friend who spent a couple of years down there and he goes through the mate ritual daily, too.
*free* spirit 
He gets naked more than people cite, I think. His three full-frontal scenes are pretty well known, but he's stripped down in a bunch of other movies, too. Psycho, The Road, Reflecting Skin, A Walk on the Moon... And he shows *way more* in his brief appearance in On The Road. I've seen Viggo's taint more than my ex's at this point.
How is it? It's on my to buy list.
Will definitely do! I can’t have enough jazz pianists on my spotify list.

I remember the envelope thing from the office chatter but that’s it. I’ll definitely check out Ali’s IMDb page. Thanks!
No problem at all!  And thanks for replying I kinda thought i effed up big time lol. I’m sure I’ll remember him now.
"Get back in the house, Jack"

That's when he turned into Joey, I think.
I just feel like it was time with his dad that he really loved. The guy set up a dynamic where the kid had to make all the effort if he wanted time together. He still wasn't making any effort to participate in his son's life.

It was like, "I'm gonna go do my thing. If you wanna spend time together, I guess you can tag along."

I might be projecting but that's a pretty selfish relationship.
The way I remember it was that he made other kinds of plans with the kid but kept flaking on him, and his kid was super gracious about it. The food truck was the only thing that stuck.
More like Eowyn, sadly.
Don't even engage. Life seems very hard for him. Let him figure out why that is.
Make it sound cool at least then. This movie will bomb. 
It’s actually become really common with English soccer players oddly enough, who get it from their South American colleagues. 
FUCKING TRIPPY. Apparently there was less than 20 pages of script, and most of the movie involves watching people move from one end of a wide vista to another in silence. Yet those vistas are beautiful, and it's riveting. I didn't like the ending, but I appreciated everything that came before it. 
Interesting note: Spotify seems to have been alerted to Green Book's presence, because I've been asking my Google Home to play him for months without an issue. As of this week, I'm getting one of those "here's a playlist that contains Don Shirley" instead of an uninterrupted stream of his work.
Oh no, you're fine! I feel really bad now haha. But please do check out his work, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
[deleted]
Pretentious jerk. 
Lol 
How about 2 Fast 2 Green? Whoa dude, you'll totally see it now.
Sounds perfect!
Most wholesome exchange I've seen on Reddit all day. Cheers
This little chat was beautiful. 
Always the shieldmaiden bridesmaid, never the elven bride.
Questioning a title is a sign of philistinism? Fuck off.
No, wanting it to be 'cool' is, you dolt.
