I've seen people from Sundance say that the trailer actually is cleverly hiding the real horror of the film for those that are afraid of it showing a bit too much. 
**Release Date - June 8, 2018**
Love it. What are those sharp violin/cello notes reminding me of? The mother! trailer? I can't put my finger on it. Plus, I heard pretty good things about this coming out of Sundance. Anyone here catch it there and can corroborate?
I cant wait for all of the critics to give it great reviews and then have audiences say it was "boring" when it gets its wide release
The Witch and Split were so good, can't wait to see this too. 
Glad Spencer from Jumanji is getting some work, movie looks like some creepy shit
I saw this at Sundance, it was favorite of the midnight category. It's a good trailer in that it doesn't spoil much. I typically think it's better to go in blind, especially if you are already planning on seeing the film, but this trailer does a good job of not giving away much at all.
in long b4 the inevitable post-release "dae this prestige horror movie wasn't that scary/good" posts.


What is it about that little girl that's so spooky? She rattles me
Caught this at Sundance last week and the last 40 minutes or so are creepy as hell. Not only is the last act terrifying, the whole movie is filled with dread and sadness that‚Äôs extremely palpable. I feel like it‚Äôs definitely going to resonate with all different types of crowds, given they enjoy horror 
I've read a lot of great things out of Sundance about this film, I can't wait.  
I never knew I wanted to see a combination of The Babadook and Downsizing.
I'm probably never going to see this (big wuss) but I just want to know what the first "shocking" scene is that all the screening reviews keep mentioning...
I have no idea what the heck is going on. I'm in!
I love A24 and Toni Colette is a fucking powerhouse. She does unnerved tension so damn well.
Very unsettling and creepy
If you haven't already seen it, Ari Aster's 2011 short film ['The Strange Thing About the Johnsons'](https://vimeo.com/70163273) is totally worth your time.  The subject matter will turn a lot of stomachs, as will the utterly inspired depiction of said subject matter, but it's an immaculately crafted piece of horror.  The moment I saw he'd directed a feature film I was strapped in.  Doubt I'll be fully prepared for the inevitable skin-crawling discomfort though.
Anyone willing to spoil me?
Another promising year for horror movies.
I want A24 to adopt me
‚ÄòFrom the Producers of The Witch and Split‚Äô

I‚Äôm sold
I'm sold. Also, this is one of the first times that as I was watching the trailer I noticed that no one in this film looks like a movie star. Like we're watching normal people. 
[deleted]
Fuck, this is so mean but that child's face is so creepy. Good for her for benefiting from it
A24 sure knows how to cut a trailer. creepy af
This looks awesomely creepy and scary.  I could see this being one of those movies that invents new visual tropes that will influence horror movies to come.  Not sure what filming techniques make it possible but its kind of cool how even the real house looks like they're in a giant doll house set or something.
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs gonna take care of me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm gonna take care of you?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut when you die...‚Äù

Idunno why that got to me so much. Not even just as a creepy thing but just...sad. Like ugh that just killed me for no reason.
im sorry, i laughed when the face swap happened at the end. looks really great though.
This looks in.cre.di.ble.

I have no idea what I saw, but everything looked stunning and very eery and unsettling.
Nice. Looks like a Charlie Kaufman horror film haha.
Now that was a fucking trailer.  Holy smokes.
That looks unsettling as hell I‚Äôm very interested in this 
If Arsenal come top 4, I will watch this by myself in the cinemas üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
If that shot of the podium is about her anxiety of speaking in public then, this director is a natural at horror.
Good on somebody for making a great trailer without a jumpscare at the end. This is how to make me want to see something.
This film is coming out on my birthday. I guess i'm getting new underwear for my birthday. 
I'm ready for my skin to crawl off, walk off, and live its own life.
This is supposed to be phenomenal. Can't wait!
Looks like another decent release. 
Well I haven‚Äôt heard a damn thing about this but that trailer is a beautiful fucked Homerun. I‚Äôll drop a dime on catching that shit in a big loud theater, lol.
Oh my god what the fuck?! This looks fantastic!
Can anyone who saw it at Sundance confirm that it‚Äôs a real horror movie, ie, no loud jump scares?
It looks like I might just shit right in my damn pants.

I'm 42.
Apparently that teenage looking dude is the kid from the naked brothers band
Fuck. Those damn miniatures freak me out.. all headless and small and weird.
Finally, a trailer that doesn‚Äôt give away the entire movie 
Stopped watching the trailer at around 0:40. I love The Witch and Split, so I'm in.
At the very beginning I thought ooohhhh the music sounds like The Witch, then I saw it has the producers of The Witch. Yes! I‚Äôve been very impressed with all the films I‚Äôve seen coming from A24.
This looks completely fucking terrifying. 
Well the trailer is super tense and scary to watch.

And the reports from Sundance said this was close to be, hands down, the best film of the event. So I am VERY much looking forward to this.
God dam! That's how you do a trailer and by the looks of it a proper horror film. That look looks scary as fuuuuck.
every 10 seconds a demon child kills someone.... *snap*
So there gonna be some supernatural link between reality and those mini rooms/dolls/model-houes?!
Is it just me or does that snapping noise in scene changes sound like the nintendo switch noise?
This is the type of Horror i fucking love, unsettling and strange. can't wait for this!
Having lip snaps every now and then in the background is a pretty comical choice considering a red clicking echidna has recently been the meme talk of the month
Is someone willing to pm me the shocking event that happens in this film? I know I need to grow some balls but certain things stay with me so I‚Äôd rather prepare myself... much appreciated! 
Was the mother, on some internal level, actually trying to save her children when she sleepwalked and poured the  paint thinner over them all?
I love Hereditary because of its brilliant vision and acting. This one truly comes alive & sticks in the mind! I have so many kind words to say about this film but [this](https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/daniels-reviews/hereditary-2018/) sums it up best.
Lot of scary movies out lately, why is that?
I assume this actually isn't a horror movie and will just be a slow movie about some kind of existential personal crisis? 
June seems so far. I'm scared it's going to get spoiled me before then.
get fucked.
Little girl kno da wey
Oh, look. The kid from Death Note. He looks like Enrique Iglesias here.
Latter half of the trailer was pretty cliche, but I'll still give this a looksy.
I hope I'm the only one who found some parts of this trailer unintentionally goofy. I'm more than open to seeing it (been loving this rich decade of horror flicks) but my skepticism is there.
I don't even know what it showed.
Went to Sundance. Can confirm. Plus I think at the Q & A after the movie the director mentioned that there were still a few effects that needed to be edited in so I‚Äôve not even seen the total final version myself. 

He also mentioned that the inspiration for this movie came from events in his own family‚Äôs life where the domino effect resulting from one event/one family member kind of made every family member of his family feel like they were cursed in some way. 

Honestly, in a world where things could follow a family through generations (e.g., addiction, abuse, suicide, mental illness, etc.), sometimes the scary thing is wondering if you truly have free will or not in deciding your own future. It‚Äôs actually very self-aware and makes the audience reflect in that way. 

Either way, it‚Äôs a pants-pissing film in the best way possible. 
No excuses. Movies looks like it‚Äôs gonna suck. And it‚Äôs a Sundance movie? I‚Äôll pass. I don‚Äôt need to be scammed anymore. 
Did they pick up A24 as distributor *at* Sundance? If so, is it common to have such a fast turn around from being distributorless to having a trailer and a release date? That's like a week-long turnaround.
Yeah, it's definitely from the mother! trailer.  I remember them using a similar motif for that trailer.
Yep!! Saw it last week at midnight during the festival. It‚Äôs good. And I‚Äôm usually not one to scare easily but it goes after the whole ‚Äúwhat is real/what isn‚Äôt‚Äù thing in the theme and the relationships are what really pulls it all together. It‚Äôs what Babadook should‚Äôve been with better pacing, consistent ‚ÄúWTF is happening‚Äù, and a (luckily) a completely different and unpredictable synopsis. At the Q & A, the director mentioned that this movie was a long time coming for him and that the inspiration for it came from real life events that he experienced in his own family. He said it was inspired by the domino effect one bad event could cause and how it completely affects every generation along the way, sometimes making it feel like they were all cursed for some reason. Hence the title of the movie. 
I saw it. It's legitimately scary. I haven't had a horror film get under my skin like this one did in a while. It's so full of dread and tension and never really lets you rest. Plus the shots, production design, and score are all top notch. I really wish these film sites would stop going so hype-wild saying it's the SCARIEST FILM EVER and whatnot. The movie will do a fine job speaking for itself with how next level creepy it is.
Those notes reminded me of The Exorcist.
Reminds me of Insidious
Honestly A24's spooky movie trailers are all starting to feel kinda samey. I mean it works, but like yeah
split has those too
Reminds me a mix of James Wan films, bits of Mother! and beats from [Utopia's Cristobal Tapia de Veer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2f6MfEzhvo).
The VVitch soundtrack?
The audiences that said that about the Witch were fucking idiots. They love insidious and bullsht like that too. Lol
Black Phillip, Black Phillip, a crown grows out his head
Was Split good? I didn't hear good things from friends
Did The Witch actually get good reviews? 
>Spencer from Jumanji

I think you mean the little brother from Naked Brothers Band.
He is definitely getting work! If you want more, check out My Friend Dahmer! Quality flick!
When I saw Jumanji I was like, " damn, Hamish Linklater" looks so young.

his mole is distracting..
[Was everybody else at your screening also trying to freak people out with the noise once the movie was over. My boyfriend won't stop doing it and it's a great way to mess with people who've seen it](#spoiler)
Or my favourite "dae think this wasn't really a horror movie because I didn't find it scary?"
Its been getting rave reviews...My boss got to catch it at Sundance last weekend, said it was awesome
> in long b4 the inevitable...

... it's a24 so its quality /s
Look, I'm excited about this. It looks great. And I love what A24 is doing right now.

That said, *They Come At Night* was not even remotely what the trailers promised, and that's bullshit. I will forever be skeptical of A24 horror movies after that. 
A24 is just polarizing. 
She has weird face.
She was Matilda in the Tony award winning musical on Broadway
I bet she is the actually the old lady
she reminds me of Gaten Matarazzo from stranger things
What makes the last 40 minute so creepy? What happens?
[deleted]
Yeah, same here :)
I really hope it's honest to God horror movie, rather than "It Comes at Night".

EDIT: Sorry I ruined your "A24" circle-jerk party, /r/movies, but it is what it is. 
The one with the bird, perhaps?
Fuck you for making me watch this. It was excellent but I never want to see it again. The cinematography was really well done. Goddamn this was a hard watch though
Holy shit... I watched the Johnson's video, then the Munchausen one.  I'm spent!  I can't remember if I took a breath in 45 minutes!!
can't really tell the quality from who produced a movie 
[deleted]
toni collette?
username checks out.
Having this right next to the 'Mute' trailer really shows a difference in editing abilities 
The trailer was actually done by [this company](https://www.avsquad.com/campaigns/hereditary/)
it‚Äôs a real horror movie
Yep. In the later dream sequence (where she thinks she‚Äôs sleepwalking again) she tells Peter ‚ÄúI was trying to save you‚Äù
scary movies have been some of the most profitable movies in recent years, not surprising more are being produced 
I asked them to!
Horror movies, in general, are very cheap in comparison to other genres because they aren't as reliant on getting big-name actors/directors and are often on a much smaller scale, so producers can pump more horror movies out and still make a profit even though fewer people see them.
Fall/Winter is when most horror films are released
I understand what your saying. I‚Äôm tired of getting hyped up over these amazing trailers only to get something completely different. 
[deleted]
One of the Wolff brothers (I'm not by computer and don't feel like using IMDb app); not sure which one, but they're getting better with each project they become a part of.

edit: Fuck it, looked it up. This is the younger brother of the kid from Death Note. They look *very* similar. Nat Wolff is in Death Note. This is Alex Wolff here.
a whole bunch of unsetlling fucked up shit
I got the same feeling.
Hi, I've done a lot of googling and cannot for the life of me find a real spoiler or plot summary as everyone says 'it will ruin the film'.

Here's the thing: I am never gonna see this movie. I don't like scary movies and this is apparently super scary, so right out for me.

If you could send me a pm, or just post spoiler text as a reply with what happens in the movie I would really appreciate it- it sounds like a very interesting story and I'd love to be able to think about it without all the, you know, horror.
How does one go to Sundance? Can you buy a ticket or something?
The trailer reminded me of an episode of the Spooked podcast, I'll see if I can dig it up.
Is it as scary as the exorcist and the shining? I really want to see it but I‚Äôm also a huge scaredy cat. 
I wonder if they‚Äôre doing any color correction or anything. This looks super bright for a horror movie.
What an awful comment.
Please, show us on the doll where Sundance hurt you. 
Ok?
No, it was at Sundance to get buzz.
You think that's crazy? Some Sundance films funded by Netflix were already up online as they were simultaneously screening them at the festival!
I think we picked up John Wick like 6 weeks before *release* when I was at Lionsgate.

At smaller companies it's possible to turn stuff around a lot more quickly. Way less red tape. Not very common though.  
The whole point of film festivals, from an industry perspective, is to show your film off to the public, and generate buzz, and get picked up. Hollywood execs attend the Festivals the same way MLB scouts go to baseball games in Cuba and Japan. They see the finished movie AND they get an audience reaction to get a sense of how well it might do.
Chthalk. 
But is it? A future classic horror I mean?
I swear they used the exact same dog barking sound effect in this trailer as in the *It Comes At Night* trailer
I didn‚Äôt like the Witch at all and my opinion is completely valid. Film is subjective, people aren‚Äôt idiots for liking something you don‚Äôt.
What's wrong Insidious? I honestly would like to hear some critiques about that movie because I really enjoyed it.
Baah baah baah!
Well your friends are very wrong 
I thought the movie was meh but James MacAvoy was awesome.
If you enjoyed Unbreakable from M. Night you're likely to enjoy Split.
Not as good as The Witch. It's just plot.
it wasntg great..
it was ok
It was average. 
I thought it was garbage. But everyone else likes it so... 
The acting by young professor x was really good but I didn't really like the last bit of the movie. You might like it though
It was a fun time, but it was in no way scary.  It was kind of campy.
Split was a 7/10 for me... right up until the very end where it went up another 0.5-1. It was *super* cool if you haven't had it spoiled for you already. It's one of the rare occasions where a final 5-8 second scene has significantly impacted my rating due to how it re-contextualizes the rest of the film.
It was pretty shit
Yes
Alex Wolff, put some respek on that name
also Patriots Day
They made a movie out of that???  Cool!
Haha, there were a few people doing it but not many that I recall. There was a Q&A after the film, maybe that contributed to it being less prevalent.
What was the noise? It's driving me crazy trying to imagine what noise could possibly be so scary!
"It's more of a drama/thriller with horror elements" always makes me laugh. 
So did The Witch, It Follows, and The Babadook, yet the common complaint among many people is that they aren‚Äôt scary enough to be horror movies (even though the only thing they are lacking to be considered as such is jump scares).

Edit: I don‚Äôt agree with those complaints, as I think those are three of the best horror movies in years, and that The Witch should be among consideration for one of the best horror movies ever. It‚Äôs just the commonly spouted complaint around these parts.
Is she supposed to be 6, 16 or 26 because I seriously can't tell
It sounds kinda dumb, but my guess is she's gonna be a doll that got brought to life by the spooky grandmother somehow, she just looks kinda doll-ish to me, maybe it's cos of the dollhouse just throwing me in the wrong direction, but that's what I get from it.
thanks for saying it, it really took me out of it. also reminds me of [running meme girl](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/017/382/1250991947631.jpg)
Erik Stoltz in Mask.
They had a couple girls playing Matilda when the show was in London, was it the same on Broadway?
That's definitely implied in the trailer but there are people here who have seen the movie and said the trailer didn't really give anything away.
I‚Äôm guessing the old lady pissed someone off and the family is cursed Drag Me to Hell style.
nope
Without spoiling too much, it all takes a VERY dark turn that I personally was kind of expecting, but not to such a degree in which it was presented. Imagery is vital to this movie and the acting is fantastic from all those involved. So excited for more to see it, because it‚Äôs a movie that i fee has a lot of symbolism too that need to be discussed
My showing was about $22 if i remember correctly, but it‚Äôs definitely worth it. The experience of being able to see a movie before the world is worth the price. They have shuttles that get you around for free so you don‚Äôt have to pay $40 a day for parking too. Definitely do it next year and research the films that interest you most in seeing so you can plan your showings beforehand and get tickets before they sell out
r/moviescirclejerk
Don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs better than It Comes at Night by far. Very well balanced. 
Is it really so horrible to watch something and it not be what you were expecting? What did you dislike about It Comes at Night besides it not meeting your definition of Horror?
I didn‚Äôt care for It Comes At Night, and Hereditary was my favorite movie of Sundance. It‚Äôs like Ju-On or Exorcist, it‚Äôs legit horror.

BTW, try not to watch the trailer if you‚Äôre reading the comments before you‚Äôve watched it. It has a few massive spoilers in there that will ruin a few things if you take those images into the movie with you. 
[deleted]
Haha it definitely slots into that category of traumatic viewing experiences that you immediately want to scrub from your memory... that being said, I have seen it a few times now.  It's a great watch with uninitiated friends :) 
Aaah awesome!! Munchausen is great too!  He has such a good handle on visual storytelling.  I'm trying to locate his other shorts on Vimeo et al but the only other title I can locate is 'Basically', which (though still very bleak in its own way) was a definite change of pace, leaning more on the comedy side of things.
Yeah The Witch has 23 credited producers. No way they've all made good movies only. 

But it is the same company producing and releasing so...good chances it will be of similar quality. 


Those producers plus A24s stamp of approval is all I really need. A24 has never really let me down.
ugh
Toni Collette in 2017*
Makes sense. I don't care for them personally but I enjoy going to the movies whenever there's something out I want to see. A lot of times, there's nothing I want to see and lots of scary movies. I find this frustrating. I just want to go to the movies.
There were a lot near the end of summer in 2017 which was sooner than I remember.
holyshit, they look almost identical in some scenes. 
Well, I didn't know there were two of them. Thanks for the info.


This movie looks really interesting. Hopefully it turns out that way.
So... like Get Out then? Not fucked up as much as confucking as fuck but the "real horror" was definitely hidden. I'd be OK with philosophical horror hidden under physical horror
And that's just what I need to get interested.
I wish I could but unfortunately I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to do that especially since the horror so intertwined with the plot itself. It‚Äôs not easy to separate the two as in other movies and there‚Äôs an irrational part of me that thinks that if I write even one comprehensive plot summary, it‚Äôs at risk of getting out into the Internet somewhere. And there‚Äôs nothing more disappointing than when a scary movie isn‚Äôt scary anymore. 

I‚Äôm really sorry, dude. It wouldn‚Äôt feel right. But if you want to ask me in June, I‚Äôd be more than happy to get back to you on that. 
[deleted]
The spoiler synopsis is on a website called Culture Crypt. Just read it and nopes out. Hell no but it must be wild to see. Too bad I won't. 
http://culturecrypt.com/movie-reviews/hereditary-2018
Yes. They sell tickets the same way they do for any music or film festival. 
Honest question: Would that be a bad thing? I strictly stay away from horror movies but could a bright horror movie work?
This is definitely already graded.  
That‚Äôs one of the things that made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre scary. Kids slaughtered on a bright sunny day. 
Probably. I could‚Äôve sworn it looked a lot darker in the theater than the way it looks in this trailer. 
Movies going to get 90% critic rating and a 37% audience rating. 
Sundance and indie films check off every box for critically acclaimed movies. 

Script 
Dialogue 
Tone
Cinematography 
Pace - usually slow
Etc 

The one box they don‚Äôt check off is enjoyability. 
Which worked!
ah, gotcha.
I hope this is the new model. People who don't live in big cities have to wait for forever to see indie flicks. 
I don't know? I can't predict that. It's well made and very scary.
Some people see PG13 and instantly hate it because "All horror should be R, and if it's not, then the Producers are pussies." I personally like them, the low rating constraint really forces creativity. 
Agreed. I avoided it for so long because of M. Night‚Äôs recent failures, but I got bored on a flight and watched it. Loved it. 
everyone can have their own opinion. Id rate it maybe 7/10
This is accurate. 
Exactly how I felt. The last shot of the movie doesn't all of the sudden make a the movie good. Was shocked how many people felt that way
Out of interest, I'm aware there is an 'Unbreakable' connection near the end (I've avoided specifics so far) but do you think it would be confusing to someone who hasn't seen 'Unbreakable' and watches 'Split' for the first time? (I've seen 'Unbreakable' but my wife hasn't)

Or is it just more of a tease for 'Glass'?
I see what you did there
That‚Äôs a good way of describing it. Couldn‚Äôt name why I didn‚Äôt love it despite loving Unbreakable. 

It‚Äôs just plot. Not a lot of depth. Something is promised and it happens.
\+ It Comes At Night

So many bad viewer ratings because it was a slow burn psychological thriller with no jump scares and "It" didn't necessarily "Come At Night" in any kind of physical, unambiguous form.
"Sorry, this 'horror' film is barely even scary, don't know what all the fuss was about." 

- Person who watched a 720p pirated version with the sound at 20%, minimized while browsing Facebook, only clicking on it when a jump scare sound effect happens so they can watch the action parts.
There are people who didn't think It Follows was scary?! Holy shit the way those things stalked everybody....god.
No worries. This one‚Äôs not jump scare heavy and definitely plays more on the-well, I don‚Äôt want to spoil it...

Just know that the best part of it is it‚Äôs complete and utter unpredictability all the way up until the end. 
Yeah, I am wary of hyperbolic reviews, especially regarding horror films.  I thought The Babadook was pretty terrible.  The Witch *looked* awesome, but was merely all right.  It Follows was interesting, but ultimately sorta silly.
Guessing that's part of why they cast her
Yeah. Child labor laws means that they need to keep a rotation, IIRC.
I should be upset about spoilers, but i know I'm too much of a sissy to ever watch this
Is this one of those artsy horrors where they jarringly cut to some weird thing happening with no explanation? 
Any chance you could pm me the ending spoiler? I hardly go to movies with a kid now and curiosity is getting me. Thanks. 
I would like a spoiler, too, please. Much too nervous to go to any horror movie!


Even if you consider the fact that it's supposed to be a dark psychological drama, I just felt there was not much meat on the bones. It was just family lives in the post-apocalyptic wilderness and meet another family, and nothing much happens until the tail end.
It wasn't a horror movie. Nothing in that movie was remotely scary.
OK, I'm officially on board.
Oh man, you should have marked that comment as a spoiler, dude
Traumatic is an understatement. 
and Split has 23 personalities.

Coincidence? ***I think not***
Naked Brothers Band mothudafuckasss
I mean personally I can't watch Horror movies. I hate them. I love reading Horror stories though. I love being able to imagine what is going on and really analyze the plot.
I'm never going to see this movie. Though I would love to read the plot or screenplay of it. Its just the way I am. So I'm also looking for the plot. If you ever change your mind please pm me!
Good on you, thanks for this.
I'll probably just never know. As I said I'm certainly not going near it in theatres.
[deleted]
I will do so but I think its unlikely. Movie snobs I guess.
This is very helpful thankyou.
Thanks! Super useful. Definitely not seeing the movie.
I had no idea. Thanks!
So then what your really saying is that the tickets sell out immediately and can be found on ticketmaster for a massive mark up soon after.
Well, The Last House in the Left is pretty horrifying, and it's in broad daylight.
That makes me happy. Just curious, do you think this'll play well with general audiences at all? I loved The Witch and ICAN but neither of them really garnered any financial attention.
So then a quality original horror movie that isn't all predictable jump scares. Perfect.
So‚Ä¶ 1. Get smarter, 2. Enjoy the movie 3. Profit.
Maybe girls ar e hesitant to meet you bevcause you have shit taste in film
What a twist~
That still seems like a recommendation. 
[deleted]
I can understand this one. I was totally fine with the slow build but I felt completely blue balled by the end. There was so much that just wasn‚Äôt explained. I would have even been fine with just an ominous non-physical evil or (preferably) some type of Lovecraftian horror but we didn‚Äôt get either. It‚Äôs like they forgot to put something in the movie.

That being said, the human drama was wonderful. If it had just been that I would have loved it
I once read it described as "nothing comes at night" and got a good chuckle.
[deleted]
There is a 720p pirated version of this movie?!? 
That really tall guy still creeps me out.
Love it. Love the quality horror movies of the last couple of years, The Witch in particular, so I have complete faith in this one.
Orphan 2

What‚Äôs an example of this in a movie? It‚Äôll help me answer you better
I dug *It Comes At Night* for the atmosphere and the way it used sources of light, I thought the whole experience was pretty disturbing, so each to their own I guess. Interested in what you think an 'honest to god' horror movie is though
This is some shite analysis buddy. 
[Okay.] (http://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3479797/editorial-horror-doesnt-scare-horror/)
*X-Files music plays*
I am the exact same way!!! 
or just wait a few months and read the wikipedia outline.

RemindMe! 5 months
Man up
Yuuuup!
Sadly, that I don‚Äôt know. When it comes to general audiences and intelligent commentaries on social dynamics that also happen to scare, the two usually don‚Äôt go hand in hand. But you never know. After all, just look at how successful Get Out turned out to be. I‚Äôd like to hope that this movie is approachable enough to fall into that category, but we‚Äôll see what happens. 
Oh you‚Äôre too good for a marvel movie? The conjuring and IT are beneath you? They don‚Äôt stimulate your intellect enough? 

Movie looks like mother! 

I‚Äôll pass. I don‚Äôt need to be fooled again. 
Wow you‚Äôre that butthurt. 
I can‚Äôt believe he was a dog the WHOLE time
Thank you for responding. Will go ahead and watch it!
What did you feel wasn't explained?  
The script reeks of it being half baked. It feels like the writer decided to just explain away any issues in the narrative as something adding to the confusion of the characters.
In an interview the director said he knew what was out there but he LEFT IT OUT so it could be up to the audience. Sorry, sir that's not being artsy, that's having plot holes and missing pieces üôÑ
I liked it but I can completely understand why someone wouldn't. If I came in completely fresh then I probably wouldn't have liked it, but I had already heard all the backlash. I already knew "nothing happens" so I kind of mentally prepared myself for a psychological drama instead of a horror/thriller were something ACTUALLY comes at night.
That tall guy striding through the doorway was the most terrifying part of the film. 
The VVitch was very divisive in my house. I loved it, my wife hated it. We still argue about it. 
That movie creeped the fuck out of me. Even the poster gives me chills.
I can't think of it off the top but there's been a lot of Sundance/TIFF style horrors that come out and it's really artsy fartsy stuff. I'd say Killing of a Sacred Deer is close to what I mean if you've seen it. I can't think of a specific jarring cut like I mentioned but just strange things happening for the sake of strangeness like what Kidman did in the car with the guy or the nonchalant attitude of the family towards everything. It's really hard to put my finger on what I mean haha but hopefully that helps if you've seen it. 
K, it's all subjective anyways.
horror- an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust.

None of these in the movie. Sure, the twist was shocking, but in a way that made you think "wait, what?" The closest argument that I could make for it would be disgust for not only the disease, but how people act towards each other. But then, would Requiem For A Dream or any other movie like it be horror? There are plenty of great horror movies that don't fall into the "thriller" genre, this isn't one of them.
Is it manly to do things you don't enjoy?
I'm just surprised with the release date since it's the same time they released It Comes At Night last year, if I were them I'd move it up a week since there's literally no big releases on June 1st. 
I didn‚Äôt say any of that. I love Marvel movies. I loved It. I also loved Mother! It‚Äôs all about knowing what you are walking into. Set expectations and respond accordingly.
What the dog chased after, how/why dog was killed and disemboweled, as well as how it got dumped inside the house because it was in no state to make it back by itself. It seemed clear that someone (or something) was trying to send a message. 
Okay that‚Äôs what I was thinking, but I wanted to understand it from your perspective. The ending I would say comes closest to something like that, but it‚Äôs part of the climax so it doesn‚Äôt seem so out of place. The story flows well and there are some instances of horror tropes, but the movie is so well done overall, that they‚Äôre just nitpicks. All of the horror is very well placed and little to no jump scares. 
True dat. 
I've had this discussion too many times and I don't feel like doing it again.
Thought the explanation was the dog just got killed by an animal in the woods, and the son, who was having night terrors/sleep walking, went out at night and brought it back. In addition, the director chose the title because he thought it sounded cool. He said in interviews that there never was a monster nor did he intend there to be one. Strangely deceptive title 
So at some point (left purposely ambiguous), the kid's dream sequences are actually not dreams.  It's implied that the kid went out at night to retrieve the dog (and in doing so, got sick).
I hate that almost every horror film depicts a family pet die. Like seriously, leave that alone. Why do animals have to be put in such movies? 
Ok cool, thanks for helping explain, looking forward to seeing it when I can!
Then next time don't ask questions to initiate conversations regarding something you don't feel like doing?
I always assumed that "it" was fear and mistrust.
The movie also had dream sequences they threw into the trailer that made it seem like there were monsters in the movie.
I didn't start a discussion about whether It Comes at Night is horror. I asked the user what they disliked about the movie.
Me too. But we can't argue that it isn't incredibly misleading. I still desire a movie where something does actually come at night, with the same title. 
You specifically asked "What did you dislike about It Comes at Night besides it not meeting your definition of Horror?" OP already told you that he didn't consider it to be horror in the first place, hence his dislike for it being marketed as such. I reiterated what he said as you clearly just ignored his comment.
