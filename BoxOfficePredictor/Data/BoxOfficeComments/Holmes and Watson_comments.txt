They made a whole movie just so they could say"No shit Sherkock" on film.
Is that Braun Strowman I see at 1:37?
[deleted]
This is from the director of Get Hard, not Adam McKay, and it really shows. I obviously love seeing these two together but this looks forgettable.
The heroin part got a laugh but I’ll say that it seems like a lazy take for a Sherlock Holmes flick.
It looks as good as the Trailer's CGI explosions.  Not very.
I really want it to be good. But it's hard to enjoy this trailer.
What's with that obnoxious screaming at the beginning of the trailer? I get it's so people don't skip the ad on YouTube but it had the opposite effect for me and I almost quit immediately.

How can a movie with this much talent involved be so goddamn unfunny even in hand-picked moments from a movie with so goddamn much potential?
Hoping Lauren Lapkus gets a few good lines--really enjoy her in CBB and other podcasts. Otherwise...yikes. 
Yikes. This is really not the tone nor the type of humor I hoped they were going for. God damnit.
Guys this looks bad 
I'm not sure i'd even want to pirate this... 
[deleted]
Was semi interested until the selfie scene. Cringed
It's by the guy who made Get Hard, not Talidaga Nights or Step Brothers. Reilly and Ferrell have good chemistry, but it doesn't matter if the writing and directing is complete shit
This will be on FX in no time.
BRAAAAAUUUUUUUUN
All I can hear is the price is right "fail" sound.
Weren't the RDJ Sherlock Holmes movies basically comedies anyway?

And casting Ralph Fiennes as Moriarty in a thankless movie like this should be movie jail worthy.
I have a cousin that’s seen a screener of this. He told me it’s complete garbage. I was very disappointed to hear it. 
Man, a very poor choice of music with “The Boys Are Back In Town”. It doesn’t fit the tone of the trailer at all or the setting. It looks like good fun with great set pieces tho. 
Not going to lie, this looks total shite.
I'll pass. I can't stand fake British accents and Will's is no better.

Also "The Boys are Back in Town" is about as cliched as you can get.
oof.  that's dire.
Hoooo boy, this doesn't look as good as I'd hoped.
I was actually really looking forward to this and now I have no interest at all in it. 
I don’t understand, if they want to do an early 20th century Mr. Bean/Get Smart, then why don’t they just do that movie with original characters. What does this have anything to do with the Sherlock Holmes mythos? All the recent reimaginations have at least some semblance with the original characters, is this concept ‘what if Holmes and Watson are idiots? Even if that’s the concept, they behave nothing like those characters in terms of temperaments regardless of IQ. 
Looks like Sherlock version of Scary Movie franchise
I was sure the hook of this was going to be that they were fans/reenacters of Holmes and Watson, and that they'd get involved in a real murder case, hilarity thus ensues. 
The only thing that has piqued my interest here is the concept that Holmes is actually incompetent, but his abilities are way over-hyped by his idiot fanboy Watson. It's a fresh-ish take, I guess? It's not like I was going to expect more from a Will Ferrell Sherlock Holmes movie.
Poor Rebecca Hall, she was great in a lot of fantastic movies but just could never seem to pull the star power she deserved.... and this... this will not be a positive for her career. 


Well this was terrible, old recycled jokes that too extremely pedestrian. 
My one weaknesses is “The Boys are Back in Town” playing in a trailer 
Selfie jokes are lammmmmme
I liked the part where he shot at the bees, but that’s pretty much it
I've always been an aficionado of Sherlock Holmes and I have no opposition to seeing differing interpretations of the character. There are so many I don't mind when they stray from the source material. I enjoyed Sherlock, Elementary, and the Guy Ritchie films. This looks awful. This just looks like Will Ferrell in Victorian England, I was hoping for a clever subversion of Holmes tropes like the film Without a Clue. My biggest issues other than the jokes not landing at all are turning Watson into a complete idiot. Holmes being an over the top somewhat foolish character can be funny, but there's no reason for a stupid Watson. This is dumb and dumber with British accents. 
Sorry, but I had to nope right out of the trailer.  Yuck.
Will Ferrell needs to get Adam McKay to cast him in one of his movies now. Ferrell is too good to still be doing comedies with gags like these. 
God damn, Rebecca Hall is a fox.
I liked the part where he tries to shoot the bees.... but that’s about it.
I love Rob Brydon on panel shows so fingers crossed he gets a bit of time to shine. 
I actually thought it looked really funny. 
Maybe we're just getting older? I laughed my dick off at Sandler and Carrey comedies in my teens. I even liked Step Brothers. But now at 32, this feels like it has the same vibe but I just wanna take a shower after watching this and tell this trailer to get off my lawn. 
Yikes
Where's the nope octopus when you need him?
Heck you all, this looks alright!
got a good laugh at watson shooting the swarm of killer bees
painfully unfunny
As a huge Sherlock Holmes fan from childhood, I have to say that this, does not appeal to me. :-(
hugh laurie! 1:40
This Christmas, get ready for:

*"SNL alums screw up their face and scream at eachother: Vol. 27"*
Looks like fun.
I mean it doesn’t look like it’ll be Talladega Nights or anything but I think a lot of people in the comments here are jumping the gun a bit quickly. A bad trailer does not necessarily a bad movie make

But yeah this trailer is very much not funny
I think this movie looks hilarious I have a terrible sense of humor I guess as soon as he said Watson I started laughing and I was smirking threw the whole thing. It's almost like Austin powers in a way I'm not really taking this movie seriously 
Well this was disappointing 
Looks stupid as hell

...I'll probably watch it twice...
Y’all can hate. I fucking loved this. 
Well, as long as there's more humor in the movie than in the trailer, I'll probably watch it. It got quite a few laughs out of me, so I'm hoping they didn't use up all their jokes.
I... can't believe how much I think this might be fun. 
Ugh this could've been so good but this trailer was just...not what I was thinking it would be. 
Those first five seconds is all i need to see. Screaming + flying spittle = hilarious i guess? Whatever floats your boat i suppose.
Ohh god... please... just don't...
I'm having trouble deciding whether or not this is good or bad. 
Where's the Will Ferrell as Robert Goulet as Sherlock Holmes movie?
Looks big budget production with 10usd budget in comedy material . Damn it's almost embarrassing 
So horrible that it's going to be awesome.
That looks really, really bad. Definitely super bland. Step Brothers is my second favorite comedy to Anchorman. Put Will Ferrell in something and I'll probably love it, put him and JCR together and I'll love it even more. It's a perfect combo for me. 

This though just looked bad. I didn't laugh at all and I went from being bored to disliking the trailer at the selfie moment. That was so awkward and forced.
Yikes.
JCR has really great comic timing.
I was worried I'd come in here and everyone would be positive.  Whew!  Looks like a pile of shit!
Thanks, I hate it.
I love these two guys but this doesn't look very good. 
Are these the scenes they cut for the film?
That was awful. I expected more. 
This looks terrible
So......Johnny English yeah?
I was excited for this movie however this appear to be just mediocre. Pity for the great supporting cast with Rob Brydon,Steve Coogan and Hugh Laurie also Ralph Fiennes.

This is not working for me at all.  It's too obvious.  Had this come out in the 90s?  Perfect.  But It's 2018.  Bit late there, fellas.
Lame.
Yeah.

What is it with the American obsession with saying Bucking-HAM.

It really ruins the accent there.

Unwatchable. 
Don't know what I was expecting, but certainly not this, this is amazingly bad.
Yeahhhhh this is going to be a pass from me.  
Good guys trailer makers didn't reveal a single joke in the trailer!
I'm sure there are a lot of people who will enjoy this movie but their humor has worn out their welcome for me.  I'll pass.
This looks dumb
Hold the phone...

At 1:38, is that Braun goddamn Strowman?
Eh, I'm kind of over the man-baby act that Will Ferrell does in his movies. I've seen this same shtick in Talladega Nights, Step-brothers, and Anchorman 2. It'll be funny for some, but not for me.
Slightly disappointed at yet another case of "let's use modern, stale jokes, but in a different setting!"
They were made too dumb in this. Funny for the first 10 seconds, or even half of the film, but I would imagine to be incredibly bored by this movie.
the heroin joke and shooting at the bees made me laugh.
House MD in the House!
Looks funny but Adam McKay didn't direct this one.  He directed Step Brothers.  No matter how good a comedy team is they really need a good director to bring out that extra bit that makes it really funny.  You can tell by the trailer it's going to be decent but not on the level of an Adam McKay directed movie.
Trailer starts with them screaming. Yeah, it's going to be trash. Still will watch it. 
This looks awful.
I'd watch anything with these two together. 
ITT: people who have watched a different trailer than me. 

Idk, maybe I'm just a sucker for these two but I found quite a bit to like in this trailer. ("Watson start panicking!!" as Reilly fires into the swarm of bees would be the highlight.) Does it look like it's reinventing the modern comedy? Nope, but I wasn't asking it to.

Now I don't want to blame ~~my low-bar for comedies~~ "it" *all* on ~~9/11~~ The Happytime Murders, *but*...
Since no shit Sherlock is in the movie I can expect no Holmes to he in there as well.
It started off weak.  I thought the middle parts were pretty funny.  Then it ended really weak.  I really hope this movie is good but it could go either way.
Hard pass
Regardless I'm probably going to see this, I love Step Brothers and Tallageda Nights and the cast looks good as well. Anything really for from Prestige Worldwide. 
I'm down.  All of you negative Nancys are too tough on popcorn comedies.  If it has 2 bits in it that I'm quoting a year later it was worth it.
Loved step brothers, saw these 2 in the thumbnail. Watched the trailer and was hugely disappointed. So bad
Watch this instead...

Michael Caine & Ben Kingsley

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_a_Clue

I'm not sure how to feel about this.

Some of the jokes are good, but... the stuff about the selfie... and Watson being a complete moron...

Note that I am not a fan of Ferrell's typical comedies where he acts like a moron, but I do recognize he can do good with a good script. This... does not have a good script...
looks awful
This looks like they just couldn't decide what to make.  I wish they had just stuck with playing it straight, like the heroin joke.  But trying to shoehorn in modern references like the selfie just feels awkward.

Honestly I'm surprised this didn't star Seth McFarlane.
Dear god why do we need yet another Holmes/Watson (or Robin Hood for that matter)?
This looks to be about as awful as I was expecting it to be. 
To the people complaining it’s not funny, you’d also be the people complaining “they showed all the funny parts in the trailer!”
This looks a bit shit tbh but I'm sure it will still have a fair few laughs knowing those two, that line about heroine was pretty good
Not convinced, looks a little behind the times.
Less important in a comedy I guess, but the accents are atrocious. The film looks pretty bad, and adding bad accents onto an already poor film is such a killer. Actually can only think of one film where terrible accents had no effect on my enjoyment of a film, and that was Your Highness.
Yikes. 
This really needed a better director. It really shows through the trailer. Get Hard was terrible. How do you get these two together and make something so bland? 
I had such high expectations.
oh.
Has Will Ferrel made a good movie since the other guys?
This is like "Your Highness" but with Sherlock.
🚫💩🕵️‍♂️
RDJ Holmes when?
Idk why they didnt just name this movie Holmies
I thought that Ethan Cohen had directed this lol. 
Lauren Lapkus, who is the funniest person on the Earth, deserves better than this 
I chuckled at the disguise part. But other than that it looks just like an average Columbia Pictures comedy. That Selfie scene is awful. 
Lost me after the no shit sherlock bit. I hope there's more jokes like the set up to kill one bee only for Watson to fucking shoot all the bees or the mustache bit.
GET THESE HAAAAANDS!
Biggest flop of 2018
Also what the fuck is that explosion
genuinely had a couple zingers in there. Better than I expected for sure.
I have been overwhelmingly excited for this movie since it was announced...

This trailer just sucked all of that excitement right out of me.

Woof.
Anyone remember Without a clue starring Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley? 
"His real name is ARTY MORTY"
Meh, it didn't make me even grin. I can already picture the whole movie in my head. I don't know what I expected but I'm a tad disappointed 
Trailer started off great but the 'No shit Sherlock' and selfie thing kinda put me off it quite a bit.
It's an okay trailer. Seems like they rely on some low hanging fruit kind of jokes. I loved Talladega and Stepbrothers, so I'm hoping the trailer is saving the best bits.

With comedies like these the concept sometimes can replace humor and I hope that's not the case here. I don't want to see a predictable plot with jokes like that selfie bit. 

I did chuckle a couple of times, especially with Reilly shooting at the killer bees. 
Hugh Laurie doing the newspaper thing from *House* was my favorite shot of the trailer 
Damn, looks pretty shit 
Ferrell trailers never seem to matter. I didn't really like the trailers for Step Bros or The Other Guys and wasn't expecting much but I was wrong about them.

This looks bonkers even if some of the jokes are flat in the trailer so I'm hoping it is all out zaniness. Hopefully like above it is in the Step Bros/Other Guys realm but I won't be too shocked if we get something in The House/Get Hard realm or something.

You know, you *could* make a Sherlock Holmes comedy if you wanted to; after all, the stories are about one guy with absolutely no social skills and another guy who, in a lot of interpretations, isn't especially bright. Put them in a situation outside their element and there's a lot of humour that could be mined.

Instead, they seem to be trying to make a Seltzer/Friedberg take on the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movie nearly a decade too late.
I was really amped for this film, until I saw this trailer. 

welp, that seemed alot less funny than i hoped.
Was interested up until I saw that it was yet another Will Ferrel comedy
Holy smokes. I can't believe how bad each "joke" in this trailer landed with me. Honestly the funniest thing was Watson shooting at the bees but I think we have a real bomb on our hands here. 
https://youtu.be/IEZFci9eaNE
The problem is that these two play the same character in every movie so it's wildly unbelievable. I couldn't even get thru the entire trailer. 
Looks horrible. Reilly and Ferrell seem to be forcing what they think younger audiences will deem funny as they themselves get older. They are taking a page out of Adam Sandlers book and putting out a big budget piece of garbage
Im glad I saw this trailer. Now I know I wont have to waste money or time seeing the movie. For the record, the last actual great Will Ferrell movie was Elf. And that was forever ago...
I prefer a Robert Downey Jr and.....what’s his face?...
Honestly happy they are back together they just were so good in step brothers. 
This looks horribly unfunny. Will still pirate and check it out tho'.
Man, I saw the poster for this earlier this morning and was excited for the trailer. Can't say I'm surprised, but definitely disappointed. I'll probably talk myself into seeing it out if love for the mid 2000's Ferrell and JCR comedies, but it pains me to say that this looks bad.
This look like cancer to me. Once I saw the Sony logo in the trailer for a comedy, I knew it was going to be shit. Someone needs to take Sony's movie making shit away from them, they are terrible at it now.
Didn't think it was very funny but at the very end hearing "mother of shit" *in a British type accent*. I fucking lost it. Wife now thinks in crazy. 
If you look at the actors only, I guess you could call this a good film. Ferrell and Reilly do have amazing chemistry together as has been shown in Stepbrothers and Talledega Nights and if this is one of those jock cheap humor flicks, I'm in for a cheap (...but those theaters prices though) laugh. I would even argue that the reason for the song was not directed towards the characters, but the fact that these two haven't been in a film together since Stepbrothers (2008). That being said, I think I can see why fans of the novels would have some issues with it, especially with the addition of selfie sticks and the use of the phrase "no shit, Sherlock".  Seems interesting for fans of the duo, not so much for the storyline in general.
Based on this trailer I feel like they should have gone full Rated R Step Brothers with it. It feels like it's being held back based on this trailer.
I think I'm in the middle on it

I'll see it because JCR and Ferrel are great but my expectations aren't that high
It will be critically panned, reach number 3 opening weekend, have a 47% on Rotten Tomatoes, and be forgotten within a month of its release.

&#x200B;

Or they'll bring back the Most Popular Film award just to nominate it I dunno
sailing vessels and prostitutes
This feels like a good concept with a good cast done poorly. 
The lady doctor bit was funny.
Idk, it looks forgettable but I’ll probably watch it and get a few laughs. The trailer is exactly what I expected tbh.
Looks like they're [blowing up](https://i.imgur.com/755n4eW.png) the Titanic
I was totally into it until they used “The Boys are Back In Town” by Thin Lizzy
Braun strowman!
Yeah, not as juvenile as I expected given the director's other work, but still way more juvenile than I hoped. 
Needs a little bit of "[Wassup Holmes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQQJ1OhARWk)".
It baffles me that people take comedy so fucking seriously.. I mean come on. Personally think turning Holmes and Watson into bumbling idiots equivilant to the Three Stooges is a hilarious idea and basically textbook satire. Saw it laughed hard, love the Hugh Laurie cameo.
So an hour n half of Will Ferrell yelling?
I don’t think I’ve laughed that hard from a trailer in a long time. 
DO they make comedies adults might find funny anymore or are they all just for children now?
painful to watch all the way through
Looks terrible lol
This premise and cast has so much potential, but it looks like they’re making the same mistake as The Happytime Murders. They should have played it straight and not gone for this over-the-top slapstick & anachronistic joke style.
I cant wait. loved step brothers. 
*Please* let there be a Bundiddle Cranberry cameo? Please?
I don’t know. It sounded great but the trailer isn’t really selling it. 
Oh boy. This won't even be the best film starring both John C Reilly and Steve Coogan coming out this year. I assume Coogan is only in this as some kind of favour for getting Stan and Ollie done?
Well at least it looks like they are having fun, not sure if it'll be my cup of tea though.
and another movie I can skip..
Seems like it’s trying a little too hard.  I can only imagine what “native speakers” think about those accents.....
looks hideous.

It makes me happy Movies like this can still get made.
Epic
This honestly looks like an abomination 
This is a fucking insult to our intelligence. WTF? 
Is this really what passes for comedy now? Jesus Christ. 
So...it’s a spoof of Robert Downey’s Sherlock?   This looks bad.  
I don't know why, but I was kinda hoping that this would be good. All hope was dashed by the trailer. 
this looks straight terrible. all the worst parts of both guys' "comedy" jammed into a movie 10 years too late.
I found the trailer mediocre at first, until "The Boys are Back in Town" kicked in and it became flaming afterbirth. Horrible song. Just horrible.
Can I give a thumbs down without watching the trailer?... really dislike spoofs I guess
What was Farrell’s last good movie? His cameo in Wedding Crashers?
Can this movie just finally kill Ferrells career? That man is jusz not funny, and all the screeming and acting lile a moron wont change it.
That movie is gonna bomb, looks rather unfunny and unoriginal to me. How did they get Fiennes to be a part in this forgetable shitfest.
I thought we all agreed to stop enabling Will Ferrell?
Step Brothers, and to an extent Will Ferrel make me want to physically scratch out my own eyes with a makeshift shank crafted by fusing both of my ears together.

I watched the trailer for some reason Im not entirely sure of right now, I guess because the setting and characters couldve provided some comedic elements the writers could evolve and I was intrigued. I was wrong. I hate this.

This is going to be Step Brothers all over again with shit faced little children quoting the movie like its just won a god damn trough of emmys whilst I stand there dazed and confused wondering what the FUCK
I’ve never enjoyed a Will Ferrell comedy. I hate Elf with a passion, stopped watching Step Brothers 30 minutes in, was bored throughout Anchorman, tolerated Get Hard, and I skip his episodes of The Office. I do like most things Sherlock-related, so when I heard Will was doing an SH movie I rolled my eyes. This trailer had me in stitches. I never expected to have any interest in seeing this movie but now I can’t wait. *Then* I scrolled through the comments here and saw near total agreement that this trailer is shit and this movie will probably suck compared to other WF movies. I’m so confused. Am I high?
If Benedict Cumberbatch and Robert Downey jr. don't cameo in this, I'm gonna be pissed

EDIT: A word
"Nothing in this century will harm U.S and British relations more than Trump." 

"Hold my fake mustache" - Will Ferrel. 
turned it off after 30 seconds. hard pass.
SNL spin-off movies are hundred percent failure.
Today we see people are starting to realize that Will Ferrell isn't funny.

Only took twenty years, but at least it's happening. 
Criiinge
If there is anyone from this film's crew reading these comments..I'm so sorry...but you knew it would be a shit movie when you started...didn't you.
This looks like it may be Ferrell's Love Guru.
If any additional proof was needed that this was going to be a dog's cock of a movie, can I also point out that Steve Coogan is in it
Meh
I dont know what to think of this now. Was looking towards seeing this cause I like John and Will together but...this reminded me of the downhill spiral that the Scary Movies went. 

 First two times they were great, but by the third time, all of the jokes started feeling forced and not natural. 
Meh.
They gave away every good joke in the trailer. All the puns, the selfie stick, the villain. Should have kept it a bit more vague with a few one liners
And then blew it in the trailer 
Keep digging Watson
Mother of shit!
"No shit Sherkock". Im using this 
Sherlock is gonna get those hands
I kinda wanna see him flip a carriage.
Mr. Monster in the Bank himself 
That’s Abe Froman, The Sausage king of Chicago
BRAAAAAAAUUUUUUNNNN
I saw Steve Coogan... that’s all I needed to see
He's not finished with you. 
It looked like he's just in his regular gear for a second. Seemed so out of place lol. Good for BRAAAUN!
Hugh Laurie just after.
Reminds me of the [Onion's Review of "the Internship".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBLBqM7B4Q)
I shake my head and wonder what society's come to as I know I'll see it opening night.
I sadly agree 
Adam McKay started steering their movies in that direction, but quickly realized it reached its peak. This guy is basically saying "HEY YOU GUYS STILL LIKE THIS, RIGHT?!"
I read that as director of Die Hard and was very confused
Don’t know much about directing or anything, but wouldn’t a comedy movie being funny or not rely more on the writing than the directing?
Which is so sad. I want to believe JCR has a much deeper talent than simply a goofy all too often supporting actor. I can picture him as a true villain mastermind. The kind that makes you second guess humanity and keep your lights on and night. Some kind of hybrid of Colonel Kurtz, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Heath Ledger’s Joker.
It looks shit. I really can't stand Americans doing bad English accents. It always sounds so hammy.
That explains it all I suppose. Get Hard was painfully not funny so there goes all my hopes for this. 
This is severely disappointing news
I miss the Adam McKay/Judd Apatow days :(
Damn, I initially read that as Walk Hard and was excited for a moment.
I thought Get Hard had some great moments. Will Ferrell confronting the guys in the park was hilarious.

However this does look like shite. But hopefully it will be better than it looks.
I read that as the director of “Get Out” and got super confused 
Get Hard is my complete and total guilty pleasure movie. I have no idea why but I can always get a kick out of it 
The guy that Bill Murray was Ethan Coen.
Yup... I laugh when he started shooting the bees, and the heroin, but then the selfie part and "oops, I hit the queen" was too cringie 
I think it was part JCR's delivery, too. Most of the other jokes did look proper wank.
Really? Lol just name dropping a drug made you laugh? I sadly didnt find any of the trailer funny.
I swear I had better ones when I was 12 playing with movie maker...
I read this and went "The CGI can't look that bad" my god... it looks pretty bad. 
I don’t know how they decided people repeatedly getting hit in the head and selfie jokes were the way to go with this. There’s so much potential. 
The lack of effort put into this is staggering. 

Period costumes and set design is on point, but the script appears to have been written on the back of a beermat in 2001...lazy is an understatement 
i know what you mean, hopefully they left out the funny parts on purpose but that's  wishful thinking really *looks out window forlornly*
Absolutely awful trailer for a supposed comedy film. This kind of humour is so outdated and forced for me 
I'm hoping for a Step Brothers level. But I don't have high hopes on it.
"No shit Sherlock" was the highlight.
Whenever I see people complain about Will Ferrell they always tend to say "he's loud and obnoxious". This trailer litterely shoves that in your face first immediately. 
LOOOOUUUD NOOOOISESSS!!!!!
> I get it's so people don't skip the ad on YouTube 

How does this prevent people from skipping an ad?  Either way they have to see this little teaser before the trailer.
It's all in the writing. You can tell that this one wasn't written by Adam McKay, did Talladega Nights and Step Brothers (and also The Other Guys and won an Oscar for The Big Short).
I was going to skip the trailer after hearing others mention how much of the story it seems to give away.

But if it's that bad, I might just watch the trailer and skip the movie.
> How can a movie with this much talent involved be so goddamn unfunny 

Because it was made by Sony and whatever comedic sense they had was ruined by having Sandler as their lead comic for too many years. 

The worst part is unless they spent too much on it, enough die hard Farrell fans will show up so they'll produce another lazy comedy. 
Imagine getting these two actors back together and not doing a Step Brothers sequel.. 
I was really looking forward to this, Step Brothers and Talladega are among my favorite comedies but I did not even smile once during this trailer. Hope it's not representative of the movie and they wanted to keep the best jokes for the movie...  
Any time Ferrell and Reilly get together, I know it's gonna be an awful comedy.  I hated Step Brothers and Talladega Nights.
Heynong man
Ho ho!
Lauren Lapkus makes me go boy-oy-oyng.
I saw a screening of this last year. If I remember correctly she doesn’t talk at all.  
Help me, Rhonda!
She mentioned on Threedom someone told her that a project she worked on did not look good and now I am pretty sure it was this.

Seemed like such an automatic homerun with this cast.  
Yep, this does not look good.
This is the only type of humor Will Ferrell knows.
I wanted to die of laughter from this trailer, but it didn’t even put a smile on my face :(
It will tank. A lot
No shit Sherlock 
I could tell when the trailer just started with them screaming at the top of their Lungs
It’s totally fine not to like this, but I laughed a lot and am surprised by the comments here. I am a sucker for comedies and find everything funny so that might be why. 
I definitely wouldn’t turn this on when its on Comedy Central 8 times a day
I’d only watch if in my home if I get paid 100 bucks minimum 
This is my Redbox free rental go to 
YOU WOULDNT DOWNLOAD A CAR
Well it is in the 19th century
My semi deflated entirely long before that.
But they oops we bonked the queen and it made a funny sound after, don't you like when people oopsy bonk each other? It makes my 2 year old cousin giggle out of his high chair every time.
But didn’t the guy who wrote Step Brothers also help write the story for Get Hard?
Talidaga Knights <3 
talledega nights and step brothers are qaulity films
Is talidaga knights the Bollywood rip-off of talladega nights? Lol
I hated Talladega Nights and Step Brothers though.
Aaaaand it is. 
Looks it, too. At least we're prepared.
Sounds better tbh
Wow thanks, now this movie looks even worse in comparison to that awesome idea.


It's an old idea, as someone else already posted this link: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096454/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096454/)
what about a blackadder-esqe treatment with hugh laurie's character as watson, blackadder as holmes and bladric as wiggins. 

The bumbling and ordinary detective work of holmes would be elevated to masterful deduction by the watson characters unreliable naration due to his inate stupidity.
Upvoted for Without a Clue, a really underrated movie with some brilliant acting. 
I knew I recognized her, you ain't lyin
Same
41 years old here.  This looks like absolute trash to me.  Had it been released in the 90s I would have been more into it.  Getting old sucks.  But it also makes you appreciate the finer things in life.  

But farts are still funny.
Sometimes the book cover is all you need to know that that book isn't worth reading.
It looks delightfully stupid 
Yeah the comments at the top suggest this isn't playing well but I chuckled a few times. I expected it to be an over the top daft interpretation, this trailer is that.
I'm concerned about Etan Cohen directing. Get Hard's direction was pretty generic. At least it looks decent so far.
I wonder what demographic finds screaming like that to be funny. Because it’s used so much these days and I don’t know anyone who likes it.
I'm kinda surprised that the reaction is so uniformly negative here, not a single positive comment had more than the default 1 point (that I could find).

I actually really liked the vibe of this trailer, not all the jokes worked of course but I'm looking forward to it more now than I was before.
This thread is full of joyless cynics. What was everyone expecting? This is disposable  fun. Reminds me of the house from last year. 
But, it's a different director. A much worse director. 
Yes! That’s what I’m talking about!
THis right here. They pretty much stole the idea and made a terrible Walmart-esque knockoff. 
Copyright expired a few years back, so Sherlock Holmes is in the public domain now. Anyone can make their own Sherlock material without paying for rights.
Yeah I don’t think they have. I think this movie is going to be 90 mins of pure jokes so idk what they think they are going to achieve judging a movie based on 2 mins of mixed jokes (some were good others were great imo, I dislike anything selfie related though so I wasn’t a fan of that, but being an adult, I’m not going to judge a movie based off 2 mins let alone one scene)
He did.
Usually with these Ferrell comedies, there are plenty of jokes in the trailer that are usually deleted or changed in the final cut.
Jude Law
I think people just had higher expectations. 
A word, full stop, comma and a useless edit.
As a Brit, I can’t see why any of us would get offended by this.

In fact it’s probably because I’m British that I think this movie looks funny, it’s a parody and I love parodies. They sound funny to me, I think that type of accent sounds ridiculous put on or not.
No shit, Sherlock.
No shovel Sherlock.

Not anymore
Ah Ha!
“Next up Justin Timberlake accidentally drives off with Jessica Biel still on top of his car”. Had me dying lmao
The Internship is absolutely my guilty pleasure movie.
Lmao same
People need work once they’re out of jail. 
Yes and no. Comedy needs good writing, absolutely.  But the director greatly influences how a scene is shot, which take to keep, whether or not to allow/use ad lib, etc etc. 
it’s an art to be a good comedy director. most can’t do it well.
He’s in a ton of serious work man 
He does. Check out “Sister Brothers”
He is very good in Magnolia
He very clearly does. So does Ferrell for what it’s worth. But you gotta pay the bills, man.
He's excellent in Gangs of New York, rewatched it yesterday and much prefer him in a serious role than a comedy one. 
Dude have you never seen magnolia, the sisters brothers, gangs of new york, the lobster, dark water, the aviator, or Chicago? Have you seen anything he has done because it sounds like you have only watched three of his movies but still needs to be heard. 
That's the point though.  It's a comedy mocking Sherlock Holmes.  
Alison Brie in lingerie
No, that was Joel Cohen
I hope somebody makes an edited version of this using outtakes that's just 2 hours of John C Reilly shooting bees. Would probably beat whatever this film ends up as.
Wonder if they're just going down the Sandler route of making dumb movies for fun and getting paid for it
I got a decent chuckle out of it. Am I a bad person? 
I laughed...
I feel like there are so many projects out now on television and theaters that have tons of potential with poor execution.

Like Wrecked on TBS or even The Orville. Both shows are fantastic ideas but just don’t quite follow through.
I hope when the queen is knocked out, she farts </Me when I was 6>
people getting hit in the head is funny dawg
Maybe it's like those action movie trailers where there are 3 explosions the whole movie and they just show them all in the trailer. 

But yeah. Reilly shooting his gun at bees, the mustache joke, that all seems great and doesn't fit with the selfie joke, the no shit Sherlock, the dumb physical gags. I'm surprised there wasn't a fart joke.

"hey guys make sure to have a 'no shit sherlock' joke in there!  OMG that would be HILARIOUS"
I had the exact same thought. Low effort writing. Bleh. 
Its from the director of Get Hard unfortunately 
U guys are taking this too seriously

Perhaps you would like some heroin?
> This kind of humour is so outdated

well it *is* a period piece 
Yeah this looks like a garbage fire to me.
Would you like some heroin?
I usually don't mind Will Ferrell as well, *Anchorman* is pretty great and some of his *SNL* work is pretty good, but why would they advertise the worst aspects of his comedy to hook you in? Like you said it's everything people complain about with his style of humour.
The Big Short has weirdly become one of my favorite movies. I rewatch it a couple times a year. Just brilliant writing, subject matter, and performances. 

And this inspired me to look up what McKay has been up to and it looks like an HBO series? Holy shit, may need to check this out.
I can't believe they actually used a "No shit, Sherlock?" joke.
The Other Guys is by far the most underrated comedy of all time in my opinion it's just so perfect 
> The Other Guys and won an Oscar for The Big Short

*Great* films. Big Short really did a good job of dumbing down the financial crisis while also being hilarious.
They should have tried to get the guy who wrote Idiocracy and Tropic Thunder to write this one
Reset
Damn, what a waste. With so many smaller roles in big films, I'd love to see her get more of the spotlight. She deserves it. 
It could have been a neat little goofy take one Holmes and Watson. Nope, they're both retarded.
I smirked at the heroin line.  But that was it.  It doesn't look Sandler-bad, but it looks pretty bad.
Fuck yeah I would
[deleted]
Okay
That's not really the same.  The concept there was that Watson was secretly the genius detective.  The concept here is that they're both idiots but Watson's stories hype up the Sherlock Holmes legend.
Not exactly. The main focus of every Holmes adaptation is supposed to be that Watson is our narrator, our window into this world and who Sherlock Holmes is. It looks like they are going in the direction that Watson is an "unreliable" narrator. This Sherlock Holmes is a bumbling idiot, but when he has a friend who **firmly believes** that this is a "master of disguise" because he simply puts on a mustache? And this moron is writing stories into the newspaper expressing how brilliant Holmes is? And the community starts to believe these stories and hire Sherlock Holmes to solve their case?

&#x200B;

This is actually a poignant commentary on how dangerous idiotic sycophants are when they build up incompetent individuals.
That's a clever idea, I always had an idea for a Holmes adaptation with a very sickly Holmes. Doyles's work implies his health isn't great.
I'm pretty sure there's a popular saying about something like that. 
Exactly! It's Will Ferrell as fucking Sherlock Holmes! It was never going to be *actually* good! 
Put it this way:  My 84 year old father will love it.  This is his kind of humor.  
I didn’t though. I had the lowest expectations. Maybe that’s the ticket. High expectations lead to disappointment, low expectations lead to pleasant surprises.
None of that makes sense.
No shit Sherlock
No shit Sherkock
Is this a guilty pleasure in the "it is good but I think people will judge me" sense or the "it is bad but still enjoyable" sense?
When I watched it at a $2 theater in Bakersfield, there was a guy in the front row with an ankle monitor named Gizmo who narrated the first 20 minutes, then left the theater. 
Thus a selfie joke followed by HAHA HE HIT HER HEAD
Yeah every time I see him in a stupid comedy movie it just makes me want to rewatch Gangs of New York. 
Have you seen that movie Star Wars?  People say I look like that guy Han Solo.
That was like 8 years ago asshole 
I choose to believe this was more about JCR and Ferrell finding an excuse to work together, more than for the paycheck
I just like to see him. He’s great in most of what he does. 
Joel Coen thought Etan was his brother??
Ferrell’s been doing pretty average/sub-par dumb stuff for a while anyway. Hoped Reilly’s involvement would mean something a bit better than the last few years. 
No! I also had a good chuckle, but it definitely lowered my expectations. 
I found it hilarious, but I’m a sucker for Farrell and Reilly movies. 
Yes.
Not at all. Shit, plan on getting stoned to the gills and go giggle at this when it comes out in theaters. Forget about my horrible existence for 2 hours. 
[deleted]
Yes, dude, plus one on Wrecked especially.  A lot of comedy potential squandered by weak, aimless writing.  I mean, fuck, GILLIGAN'S ISLAND did a better job at getting comedy out of the whole, "marooned on an island", thing.  
Youre insane. Wrecked is a masterpiece you philistine! 
I feel like it would have been funnier had they left off his name or made the gag so that would have been said to other cast members once or twice but never Sherlock.  Saying no shit Sherlock *to Sherlock* ruins it completely.
you'd think a pair like that would have enough clout to get a decent director 
When McKay isnt available, Ferrell seems to consistently work with shitty directors with low experience. Lately its been Sean Anders and Etan Cohen, who are both hacks. 
I liked Get Hard :(

EDIT: mixed up the titles of Get Hard and Walk Hard. Carry on
I do believe I smirked at that
Only line that got even a smirk out of me. Man, I loved those two but that was just painful to watch.
I thought he said Heron and was so confused. 
[deleted]
I have a similar feeling about Up In The Air. I can't pinpoint exactly what I love about it, but it has great performances, and a cleanly executed plot. 
Succession is a great show
HBO series, Succession, is excellent. Similar in many ways to The Big Short.
Thats how I feel about Moneyball. 

I have no idea why I love it, I dont even like baseball, I just really love that movie.
I can't watch it because of annoying it is to watch a Hollywood actor pretend to be autistic...
I was more excited to see The Big Short when it came out in theaters than Star Wars:The Force Awakens. 
The Big Short is criminally underrated
Succession is absolutely fucking incredible. **Highly** recommend, the writing and characters are stellar. 
Thanks for the F shack

Signed,

Dirty Mike and the boys
that honor goes to MacGruber, but other guys def gets four out of four desk pops from me
Desk pop!


The holy trinity of comedies:

The other guys
Galaxy Quest
Tropic Thunder
I think it would have been hilarious is Holmes was inept, and Watson was ignorant, but thought he was genius. Like, every amazing Holmes story we’ve heard was really just Watson being fooled over and over again. 


This doesn’t look like that. 
Username checks out.
If only this movie could execute this idea with any real intelligence or gravitas, it would be worth watching... something tells me, it won't.
I'm pretty sure I was already referencing it.
It's everything you got wrong with your comment.
Sherkock*
The majority of people seem to dislike it but I love it.

I don't know why, it's just very feel-good and easy to watch. Never fails to cheer me up.
I mean its absolutely a google propoganda movie. And makes up a completely arbitrary process for how the internship works. 
Bad but enjoyable.

Movie is ok'ish, but the scene where their team is trying to come up with a new app and Vince Vaugn is describing what is Instagram and saying putting pictures "on the line" is funny.
I mean, I’ll go ahead and say I saw it in theaters for free and it was not worth it. It’s a 1 and a half hour commercial for google and it’s mostly not funny (the will Ferrell mattress scene was funny in my memory, couldn’t tell you what happens in it)

But this guy is entitled to like what he likes, I won’t fault him as an individual, but from my perspective: I’m normally against the concept of guilty pleasures, but I’d feel guilty for enjoying that mess of a corporate propaganda film.
He's really good in serious roles, but he's best in comedys. Walk hard is a masterpiece
Absolutely. I imagine it has to be a lot more fun too, which I respect. I just feel like he is undervalued and capable of a defining performance of cinema.
No you bozo, Joel Cohen was the writer of Garfield that Bill Murray says he thought was one of the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel
Reily's involvement doesn't matter. It's Adam McKay who gets the best of Ferrell.
Yeah Ferrell has pretty low standards when it comes to films (always had to be fair) but Reilly is almost exclusively in good films or at least films made by very interesting cast and crew. Thats the only reason I thought this could grow past Etan Cohen
I find all of ferrel’s movie below average. Would rather watch sandler than this buffoon. 
Same. I was slightly engaged because one of my favorite improvisers is in it, and the supporting cast is so stacked. But the trailer makes it seem like a pure Ferrell-Reilly vehicle with celebrity cameos.
I think The Orville has some genuinely interesting sci-fi ideas in it and a pretty engaging cast, but as with all Seth MacFarlane stuff the comedy is really plodding and heavy handed. I'll deffo watch the second series but it's not getting me super excited.
Why hasn't Kent Alterman directed a single movie other than Semi Pro?  That was really underrated
Etan Cohen wrote Idiocracy, Tropic Thunder, and MIB 3. Actually a little surprised this looks so bad. 
Anders is a bit better than Cohen.  Get Hard was unwatchable and I thought the premise had potential, but you can tell it had a very uncreative director
Get Hard was garbage
I slightly smirked at "mother of shit" at the end for some reason.
If you like it more power to you, I just can't get along with it at all.
You like failing economies? 
Up In The Air is one of my favorites as well.  It’s got this kind of magical depressing yet hopeful vibe throughout, I absolutely adore it.
I'd toss in a mention of *This Is Where I Leave You*. Just fantastic performances, a touching, but simple plot. It's one of my favourites. 
"Hey! Are you Dirty Mike and the boys!
They call it a soup kitchen.
We have a jar of old mustard and a poodle...
MacGruber is pretty great 
[deleted]
Like Sir Digsby Chicken Ceaser. 
You seem to have forgotten the meaning behind it... 
It is a very positive movie focused on redemption and two "old" guys finding their place in a young world. It is also vintage Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. 
It helps that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have insane chemistry.
I love it. I see it as basically a sequel to Wedding Crashers since they play essentially the same characters 
I mean, if u can ignore the fact that the whole movie is an ad for Google, it's a competent enough feel good comedy 
No argument, and I'd be happy to watch something of value from either one of these guys.  

And to not disagree too strongly with the post I replied to; I'm sure the paycheck doesn't make it *harder* to get out of bed in the morning...
Wait Joel Cohen and Etan Coen are brothers, right?  
  
Jk. Bozo. I love it. Seriously, haven't been called that in a while. 
King Kong 
Dewey Cox wants a word...
Ferrel has done a couple of decent ones.  But only a couple.
Lapkus?
I actually feel the Orville is McFarlane's desire to do a real Star Trek series, but could only get the money for it by throwing jokes in there because he's a funny-man.  Many of the jokes feel shoe-horned in as a result, instead of just being genuinely funny.  Take that out?  You have some pretty solid trek-type stories.
Yeah as far as the bad Will Ferrell movies go, Semi Pro is arguably my favourite. So weird that it costars Woody Harrellson, I had no idea that was him for years.
What did you think of Get Hard? 
I would take Get Hard over Daddys Home but I do think Daddys Home at least kind of does what it sets out to do (family comedy) whereas Get Hard falls completely flat as an R Rated comedy. 
i still think 'kicking and screaming' was his worst (will ferrell that is)
I'll make a point to see it! 
Such a fun movie. I need to rewatch it some time.
You seem to have an inability to comprehend sentences.
kind of like the movie Intern starring Robert De Nero as the old guy trying to find his place in a young world
I don’t think google needs any advertisement.
Im calling a lot of people bozo now, its like my new thing. 
Kong Skull Island was pretty good and Reilly was the best part for sure. 
You take that back this instant. I fucking love Walk Hard, one of the most quotable movies of all time, the music was really well done... I just...

I knew there were terrorists, child molesters, lots of bad people in this world...

I didn't know there were people like you.
Walk Hard is great, what's your point? 
Yeah, though someone on this subreddit said that they saw a screener earlier this year and her role was substantially reduced.
Semi pro is fuckin hilarious, I don’t understand how it’s got a 22% on rotten tomatoes, that’s one of my favorite Ferrell movies forsure 
And how can it even be lumped in with Ferrell’s bad movies? Semi Pro is hilarious and I am not sure how that one went under the radar for so long. 
It took me a few watches to truly enjoy Semi Pro. I find it hysterical now and am a sucker whenever it's on. One day for Halloween I hope to be Jackie Moon with fro and all.
Ferrell fatigue at the time
