Honestly the most tolerable stuff to come out of Happy Madison this decade.
I really liked the first 2 so I definitely want to see this.
More this, less jack and jill.
I’m not gonna lie, the whole Dracula finding a love plot really interests me. I’m sort of looking forward to this. 
The Twilight bit in the second film was the best throwaway gag I have seen in a while.
“Adoobie day, Shula, ekubi day?”

Why is this so funny!?
Sony delaying this film for a year and a half to bring Genndy Tartakovsky back was the best decision they could have made.
I was expecting to dislike this movie but was pleasantly surprised that it was interesting at times. It was sometimes boring but it did cool things too. [This ](https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/hotel-transylvania-3-2018/) covers it well.
as if the cowboy movie wasnt a masterpiece
Because it's Adam Sandler
Damn you came a long way back just to make what I have to hope is a joke.
Your loss
