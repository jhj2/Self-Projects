When you say 'Isle of Dogs' out loud it sounds like you're saying 'I love dogs'.
So Escape From New York, but with dogs . . . . . I'm down
Ooh my username is finally relevant!
The last time I saw a dog in a Wes Anderson movie, it got skewered by an arrow. 

I go into this film with trepidation.
Finally Wes Anderson is back on Stop-Motion Animation after Fantastic Mister Fox, I cannot wait. 
This looks rad. I'm curious how the film handles language. All the dogs speak English, while the boy seems to speak Japanese only. And yet there are human characters speaking English? Since the cast uses [many Japanese actors](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5104604/combined), it should be interesting.
You had me at Wes Anderson.

It's almost criminal we have to wait 4 years for a new Wes Anderson movie. Looks like it'll be worth the wait!
The timing of the voice cast reveal is genius.

-Middle column staggered reveal- "Dang, this is a pretty solid list"

-Simultaneous dual column reveal- "Woah! Geez, what the f-fasfsfhasofoa" 
Damn, that cast. This might be my new cheat movie when playing Six Degrees of Separation. Really looking forward to this!
This looks incredible. I love the exaggerated features on the humans. Cranston sounds like he's going to give a great performance. Ugh I can't wait.
"Darnit, I've got a crush on you."

I cannot wait for this. 
Isle of Good Boys
Wes Anderson- Check

Edward Norton- Check

Bill Murray- Check

Bryan Cranston- Check

Jeff Goldblum- Check

Scarlett Johansson- Check

Well damn ring me up for a ticket aboard the hype train too!
People in London confused it's not about Canary Wharf.
You wonder why Wes Anderson films take so long to come out.. then you see a trailer like this and it makes perfect sense.

The attention to detail in his stop motion is unreal, man.  This should be brilliant.
Honestly this is already the best movie I've ever seen.
Wes Anderson, stop motion, AND dogs?

That's not fair, you can't just TAKE money from me like this. 
So very, very Wes Anderson. I wonder what his films will be like in his 60's? 
I really believe Wes Anderson is one of the best filmmakers currently working; I know lots of people aren't too keen on his idiosyncratic stylization but his films have such an intangible quality that I've never felt in anyone else's. 

They elicit certain feelings from me that I can't even explain; it's like some strange combination of both melancholy and warmth, both sadness and comfort. They make me reflect briefly on things in life that I've lost -- whether that be people, friendships, passion for something, my carefree youth, etc. -- but then comes back around to remind me that heartache and loss is a part of life, and reassures me that everything is going to be okay in the end.  

I get inexplicably emotional during the strangest parts of his movies, and yet moments later I find myself laughing and realizing that even with all the ups and downs and highs and lows, life is just a big, beautiful gift and we should enjoy every minute of it.

Needless to say I am so fucking pumped for this movie.

***

**EDIT:** Thank you for the gold kind stranger :) 

And for those wondering, here are the "weird emotional" (for better or for worse) moments I get from each of his films:

* **Bottle Rocket:** *"Her name is Inez!" "And my name's Dignan, man, so what? She never loved you, man."* Also the ending, *"Just give me this one... They'll never catch me, because I'm fucking innocent."*

* **Rushmore:** Too many to count, honestly, but some of my favorites: *"She's my Rushmore, Max."* // The first time Mr. Blume meets Max's dad (*"It's good to meet you, Mr. Fischer."*) // And the ending tears me up every single time, when "Ohh La La" starts playing and Rosemary takes off Max's glasses and just looks at Max then kind of sighs and smiles.

* **The Royal Tenenbaums:** Richie's suicide attempt, of course, but the part that gets me THE MOST is the very end, when Royal gives the Dalmatian to Chas and they're both kind of petting him and Chas says, *"It's been a rough year, dad."* Holy shit, absolutely kills me.

* **The Life Aquatic:** Again, Ned's death is an obvious one, but I don't think I've ever NOT gotten misty-eyed when Steve and the crew see the Jaguar shark for the first time (that music, uuuuugh, perfect) and Eleanor leans to Steve and says, *"It IS beautiful, Steve,"* and he says, "*Yeah, it's pretty good... I wonder if it remembers me."* Oh my god the feels.

* **The Darjeeling Limited:** *"I've still got a lot of healing to do,"* and the entire flashback sequence to the day of their father's funeral and how hectic everything was and it juxtaposes with the funeral of the small boy and how quiet and calm everything was. That entire segment is just.. wow.

* **Fantastic Mr. Fox:** Lots of little moments here that always get me, some sad, others hopefully. *"I love you, but I never should have married you."* // *"Ash...I'm so glad he was you."* // and my favorite: *"We're all a little... 'different.' But there's something kind of fantastic about that, isn't there?"*

* **Moonrise Kingdom:** Not as many specific "moments" in this one, per se, but the entire thing is very touching and very nostalgic of that feeling of young love and just wanting to BE with someone (and not understanding why sometimes you can't be). Although I do always get touched when Sam's talking to Captain Sharp... *"Did you love someone ever?" "Yes, I did." "What happened?" "...She didn't love me back."* So matter-of-fact-ly. 

* **The Grand Budapest Hotel:** Again, this one is more overall a story of joy, but man, when they talk about Agatha's death at the end and old-Zero talking to the young writer tells him *"No, the hotel I keep for Agatha. We were happy here."*... I fucking lose it.
[MFW I realized I have to wait another 6 months for this movie to come out.](https://i.imgur.com/LeTj9Kf.jpg)



Stop motion is the greatest. I really fell in love with the craft in 2009 when Henry Selick did Neil Gaiman's Coraline and Wes did Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. Both those movies are outstanding. I really wish more high caliber directors would take on the art form. In 2015, Charlie Kaufman released Anomalisa which was absolutely brilliant but unfortunately fell under the radar like an early Coen brothers movie.





Not only this movie looks fantastic, but the cast is pretty awesome as well! Bryan Cranston, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Fuckin Murray.

I need this now.

I love Wes Anderson. I love doggos. This is gonna be a good time.
The cast on this is unbelievably stacked. Can't wait
For those wondering, this is the song https://youtu.be/qju3FEcKTrw
the reversal of being able to understand the dogs, but not the main human character seems like fun
The cinematography here, even though it's animated, is incredible. Wes Anderson's style lends perfectly to animation and he seems like he's taken it up a notch since Fantastic Mr. Fox.
Fun tidibit! The title card is opposite in the two languages. I only know Chinese, but the word Isle is placed over 犬，which means dog, and then the word Dog is placed over 島，which means island. This movie looks great!
S T O P - M O T I O N  B O Y E S
I watched about 30 seconds and stopped because why bother?

It's Wes Anderson. OF COURSE I'M GONNA SEE IT!
"Because he's a 12 year old boy, dogs love those"

Sold!
I am so cussing excited to see this cussing movie. What the cuss.
A big yes to this movie. The thing about Wes Anderson movies are you know there's an emotional point in the movie that will hit you like a ton of bricks, but you don't know when. I'm thinking the same thing for this movie....Like I'll be questioning when that moment hits me and I'll be sitting there like a babbling idiot in tears.
Who was the narrator at the beginning? 
I love how he's taken a lot of criticism over the years for killing/hurting dogs in his films and he responds with a film pretty much called I Love Dogs. 
Trailer song, for those interested:

This looks great! 

Awesome cast, original looking story and amazing stop motion animation!
Damn, Wes Anderson can put a hell of a cast list together!  I can't wait for this, he hasn't made a bad film yet IMO.
A Wes Anderson film about dogs? Can't wait to cry till i puke over this
Yoko Ono! :0
I predict this movie will be quirky and pastel toned!
r/intentionalwesanderson
That is an expensive cast.
I love this man and his movies. I can't wait to see it.
YES!  March 23, 2018?   Nooooooooo!   I can hardly wait to see this in a proper theater.
Wes Anderson and Dogs.... there is like a 90% chance this movie will make me cry.
TIL that Reddit loves Wes Anderson. I love his movies, but I almost feel like they Wes Anderson too hard sometimes. With that said, I know I'm going to love this movie.
The most Wes Anderson that Wes Anderson has ever Wes-Andersoned. Looks great, though.
So excited to see Wes go back to stop motion with this. Fantastic Mr Fox is one of my favorite films and this looks great.
fun fact: the japanese title translates literally as Dog's Isle, so as the title is introduced word by word at 1:55, the kanji and the english text are reversed. you'll see the word "isle" displayed over the kanji (犬) for "dog" and "dog" in front of the kanji (島) for "isle"
What in the fuck did I just watch and when will there be more?
Needs more dogs. 
Wow that's a start studded cast, I can't wait to--

> Yoko Ono

Oh no
Good god this looks incredible. Sometimes Wes Anderson films are a little too...Wes Anderson-y for me (Moonrise Kingdom in particular) but other times they're just incredible. This looks right up my alley.
Those dogs are terrifying. 
My kid will have just turned 3, and I think I just unilaterally decided that this will be his first movie going experience.
Gorgeous animation. And the fact that it's set in a dystopian type of society makes it look even more appealing. 
I wonder if that was intentional or not.
When I was in 8th grade I had a huge crush on this boy. I was unpopular; he was moderately popular. But we both loved Piers Anthony books. One day I noticed he was reading "Isle of View" and even though I'd already read it, I asked if I could borrow it just so I could tell him "I love you" without him knowing. 
holy moly! that's really cool!
"Isle of Dogs" is also the name of a satirical Elizabethan play that was apparently so nasty that every copy of it was suppressed and now nobody knows what was in it.
Isle of You
I gasped when I said it out loud.

Then I said it again and it still made me gasp
Yeah, I like dags.  
I would love it if Kurt Russel did a voice in this. But it seems like the voice talent is already pretty stacked based on the ending cast list.
*Snaaaaaaaaaaaaake* I mean *Doooooooooooooog*
Kinda like, Chicken Run?
I was thinking Saving Private Ryan. "Have you seen this sol- dog?"

Edit: Woof 
WTF!!! THAT'S AMAZING!
"Was he a good dog?"

"Who's to say?"
And before that, they were debilitated with tranquilizer-laced blueberries. 

And before that, it was missing a leg and left on an island with vicious pirates. 

And before that, it was run over by a car. 
Sad things do happen to dogs in his films but I love how he incorporates them. Plus they always have great names. I always wanted two dogs named Buckley and Sparkplug. 
They're all gonna die a brutal death. That seems to be the trend in most of his movies. Examples:

Tenenbaums- Buckley gets smashed by a car.

Darjeeling - implied through dialogue the Anjelica Huston's dog was killed by a cobra or a tiger - I can't remember.

He also threw a cat out the window, so let's see if this movie has any of them...
Not as bad as the dog scene in The Lobster. 
Fantastic Mr Fox is one of my all time favorite films. It has such a bizarre but wonderful/beautiful stop motion animation. It's a movie that I come back to a lot because it is really really well made. I am so pumped for Isle of Dogs
The touches of stop-motion in Grand Budapest Hotel were lovely visually.
I feel much the same way. I've never cared much for Wes Anderson, but Fantastic Mr. Fox was wonderful. I could definitely go for another movie like that. 
[deleted]
I was wondering this too. the dogs are all japanese so they must be speaking "dog", It looks like the majority of the movie the dogs will only have direct contact with the Japanese boy.
I wonder why the Japanese setting? Maybe it will make more sense in the movie, but I'm still super excited on it. 
i think it's so there will be no direct verbal communication from dog to human. the humans speaking english will be off-island.
I'm going to guess that the film will allow us to understand people depending on which perspective we're following at the time. 

Like for instance when we're with the dogs they will speak English, but everyone else will speak Japanese. The dogs can understand themselves, but not others, same with the audience. Then when we're following people, like afro girl, they will speak English, we can understand them, but we can't understand the dogs. 
It looks like the dogs speak English to other dogs, and the humans will speak English to other humans. But in order to capture that dogs and humans can't understand each other, when the film is showing things from the dogs' perspective, the dogs hear humans speaking Japanese. When the film is showing a human's perspective, the dogs will just be barking.

I could get by on Wes Anderson and the Coen Brothers. 
They sure did.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalWesAnderson/
This is the most /r/movies type comment. 
Something about that moment really reminded me of Kubo. 
Reminds me of Bill Murray's lines from The Life Aquatic about 11 1/2 being his favourite age. 
Yeah, when the trailer can bring me to near tears with a single line of dialogue, I know it's something I'll probably love.
Reminds me of a Demetri Martin joke.

"I heard this lady say "I love kids." That's nice, a little weird though. It's like saying "I like people, for a little while." "How old are you? 14? Fuck off!" You can say "I love kids" as a general statement, that's fine. It's when you get specific that you get in to trouble. "I love twelve-year-olds."

Judging by the look of this it must've taken a long fuckin time to make.
good god has it been 4 years?  fuck you father time and your twisted ways! 
8 years since Fantastic Mr. Fox if you've been jonesing for some more stop motion wes anderson!! Im beyond excited for this movie.
Budapest Hotel was so good. 
Isn't this the longest period between films that he's ever done?
I just saw Moonrise Kingdom last weekend with some friends because we were missing some Wes Anderson visual aesthetics and story telling. 

Love that Edward Norton is back too(though only voice over). SInce Birdman he has been kinda missing. (Yeah, I am really trying to forget about Collateral Beauty) :D
Absolutely! I can't wait!

What's your current one?
> Cranston sounds like he's going to give a great performance

All you have to see is his name on the casting list to know that he's going to be great in whatever it is he's doing 
That's the most Wes Anderson line since the last one
The delivery of this line in the trailer is flawless.
There's a part of me gutted Greta Gerwig isn't playing a dog.
Moonrise Kingdom vibes from that line.
or 'I love dogs'
> Isle of G O O D B O Y E S 

FTFY
Isle of who's to say
Also Harvey Keitel, Tilda Swinton and for some reason Yoko Ono 
> Edward Norton- Check

> Bill Murray- Check

these two are implicit, they'd act in whatever wes anderson wanted, "you want me to star in your home porn movie, sure thing wes"
Does anyone know why Jason Schwartzman isn't in this? Did he and Wes Anderson have a falling out? It's odd, especially since it's a stop-motion. It would've been easy to get him to record.
Ken Watanabe as well!
Is this Scarlett Johansson's first Wes Anderson film?
The Isle of Dogs might be the least Wes Anderson part of London
Yeah, I was wondering how on earth they could make a Wes Anderson film about the least interesting part of London.. 

I go there for work quite a bit. Boring doesn't begin to describe it. 
\> Remembers all the times Wes Anderson kills animals in his movies

\> Realizes this is entire movie about dogs on trash island

\> Silently prepares self to be wrecked emotionally
I doubt many dogs'll die in the movie, yeah I'm sure we'll see maybe 2 or 3 or so (Outside of main cast, maybe a little more), but I doubt it'll be anything crazy. Emotional, probably, but it's not gonna be A Dog's Purpose level.
Maybe we'll get lucky and Cranston will become one of Anderson's go to actors.
LADKSFHDFH I KNOW! It's a WES ANDERSON about DOGS set in FUTURE DYSTOPIAN JAPAN with EDWARD NORTON AND JEFF GOLDBLUM AND BRYAN CRANSTON. FUCK!
If you capitalize all of the letters in a single word in the phrase,

"That's not fair, you can't just TAKE money from me like this."

 It would change the meaning of the sentence very slightly.

[Edit] Typo
Not sure. I just hope he continues making films for a while. There’s something quite special about them. 
Symmetry will be so high you'll only need to watch half the screen to appreciate it
For me, it's when the actor makes an expression, and there is that moment of hesitation before the shot cuts to.  So many directors snap back and forth no all around where as Wes Lingers on a face, let's it go through an emotion rather than state it.
Nostalgia. Somehow the dude has figured out how to boil down the ingredients for nostalgia and injects it into every movie he directs.
It'd be more of a surprise if Bill Murray wasn't in a Wes Anderson movie.
Haven't watched the trailer, are either of the Wilson brothers in it?
When does Wes not have an incredible all-star cast though? That's kind of his thing haha.
No dafoe though....
Annnnnd no Owen Wilson.
Exactly my thought. 
It could be scheduling stuff. Honestly, as long as I see Edward Norton, I'm completely fine with it. His voice and appearance just always fits into the movies without much of a change. That's just my opinion, though. 
He wasn't in Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic or Bottle Rocket either
> I love Wes Anderson. I love doggos.

You must be some sort of masochist, because Wes Anderson often kills off the dogs.

The soundtracks alone make his movies worth watching... listening... to. 
Thanks! I'd only heard the Oh Sees cover of this song and thought it sounded a little different in the trailer.

Yes! [This shot is absolutely beautiful](https://imgur.com/a/r4BCe)
That's how Japanese is structured. If you remove the English words from the characters, it'll translate to Isle (or Island) of Dogs. Reverse the characters to match the English and it'll say Dog of Islands. 
I only know Japanese, but the kanji are the same. Made me tilt my head in confusion for a second, and then I got it.
T R A S H B O Y E S
Plus it gives away a good chuck of the plot if you watch the whole way through.
Sounds like Courtney B. Vance to me.
There was also a little bit of Prokofiev. "Troika" from the film he scored called Lt. Kije.
She will scream in the background at moments of heightened tension.
with deadpan line delivery?
They probably did it for cheap. 
I think you mean 95%
I keep expecting to be sick of Wes Anderson, but I'm not at all.  Rushmore is in the top three movies of all time for me.
"We are looking for his dog, have you seen him?"

"EEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA~~~~~"

"I think that means no"
I don't think anything Wes Anderson does is an accident.
Isle of dogs is also a little "island" in London, south of canary wharf.

Too cute 
Did you also ask to see The Color of Her Panties or did he ask you?
Too bad Piers Anthony writes all that creepy weird pedo stuff.

This is why I love Wes Anderson. 
One of the dogs should have an eye patch
Kurt Jack Russel.
Damn, Kurt Russell would be a great name for a dog.
His brother Jack Russel might be in it 
That would be high praise.  Chicken Run is an awesome movie.
Chicken run was "Great Escape", which imo is quite different from "Escape from NY"
That's The Great Escape with chickens though.
Which is actually just The Great Escape but with chickens.

It's a part of London. And like much of the weird seemingly straightforward names it's not likely named after an island of dogs. Some say it's named after ducks and the pronunciation got corrupted over the years. There'll be a TIL on the front page by the weeks end which'll get more into it i reckon. 
For a second I thought Wes Anderson made a film about/based in East London, but alas it wasn't to be.

'Limehouse Golem' seems to be the closest I can think of off the top of my head (I live in stepney)
I mean it's not really. The Isle of Dogs is a place and all.
It’s an entire area of centra London 
I loved that exchange so much the first time I saw it.

Also Royal Tenenbaum took his grandchildren to see dogfights to toughen them up. Such a great character, horrible but wholesome at the same time.
And the dog that was poisoned by the blueberries already had rabies.
Yeah someone needs to question his obsession or hatred(?) for dogs haha. Maybe he just likes using them as it brings something out in us, the viewer.
Why blueberries? Because beagles love blueberries.
To be fair the dog originally belonged to the Pirates

I'm guessing you weren't refering to that.
Such a good movie, such a disturbing scene...
I thought The Lobster was a very good movie but I gave up on liking it after that scene. A really good movie, but a really fucking mean one too.
It's such a cussing good movie.
I love the pancake scene for some reason. Cracks me up every time.
I really liked the movie, but all the same, the Dahl fan in me was kinda bummed at how utterly different the story was.
If what I think is happening, is happening, it better not be.
Absolutely, GBH was a remarkable film. 
That was probably one of the most visually appealing movies of all time. Just the first 20 minutes had me in wonder and awe. 
[deleted]
I was in college when this was released and we were doing a project on animation, so Fantastic Mr Fox was used as a good example of stop motion and as part of the reasearch we watched and read a load of behind the scenes stuff. They seemed to be trying really hard to make it look as 'stop motion' as possible, to the point where they were really exaggerating the flaws and claiming it was all part of stop motion. They claimed things like fingerprints on the models, slightly jerky movements, wonky scenery etc. were all an unavoidable part of the art.

Then we watched an Aardman documentary on Wallace and Gromit and it proved it all wrong by showing perfectly smooth animation with no flaws or fingerprints.

I get the art style they were going for and it is certainly distinctive, but it must be frustrating for an animator or modelmaker to be asked to deliberately do their job badly.
Great point, I can see why that decision was made. The dogs are speaking English for "us", the audience, so if the boy spoke English it would seem weird that they couldn't understand each other. 

I almost think then that the human characters all shouldn't speak English, but I'm sure it works.
If I had to guess, knowing Anderson, he was taken with the fashion and architecture from this period.

EDIT: I didn't realize the film was set in the future. The film's overall aesthetic sill looks like a retro throwback to me.
Could be because Tokyo has an island, [Yumenoshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumenoshima), which was built from landfill.  William Gibson wrote about it in Neuromancer, some passages talking about land made from "gomi" (Japanese for junk), and it wouldn't surprise me if Wes Anderson got the seed of the idea from there.

Fangoria Magazine says "Da Fuh?"
It looks like they sent us some kind of communique!
Nah. I need some more variety than those two otherwise their styles lose their charm. 


Fincher, Scott and Villeneuve for a base. 

Nolan, aranovsky and bong jun ho for meat visuals. 

Anderson and Coens and Wright for pacing and off kilter comedy. 

Gaspar noe cause why the hell not. 

Micheal bays for when I hate humanity. 

Jon woo, spike lee, and guy Ritchie for cheese. 
Oh, good, I thought i was just unreasonably sensitive. That line made me cry.
I love how his style becomes more pronounced with every new movie. At this point it almost looks like a parody of himself, but it's still so fantastic.
I mean, teaching dogs to speak English isn't easy.
By Great Odin's Beard, FUCK YOU FATHER TIME!!!!!
Good dog*
Fantastic Mr. Fox is so unbelieveably good, seriously one of the best animated movies since 2000, if not at least one of the funniest. I think it might be Wes Anderson's funniest movie.
And Moonrise Kingdom. 
One of those rare movies where I started getting depressed as I could tell it was reaching its end. I was so engrossed in it, I didn't want it to end. 
Now I know why i recognized Ed Norton and F Murray Abraham's voices.
I have great memories of watching this movie in the theater with a good friend who moved away shortly after. It was fun to watch and I immediately associate it with spending some quality time with a close friend.
Well, animation takes a *liiiiittle* longer than most live-action, and stop-motion is no exception.
I think he did a voice in sausage party if that counts at all haha.

Edit: sausage party not fest. 
Someone says that every time
The Royal Tenenbaums and Grand Budapest tie for this honor, it's hard to beat.
Currently, Ocean's 13. That's usually a great springboard for trying to connect actors easily.
He will never top his role as Hal though. 
The whole thing was the most Wes Anderson thing ever. I love how his style keeps on getting more tuned and pronounced. You know those great parodies of Wes Anderson that crank the dial up for comedic purposes? Well this is even more cranked up than those.
Yup, that line was down right parodical.
It's so strange that this is their first time working together. Gerwig seems like the perfect Wes Anderson actress.
Didn't even catch that! 
oh my god it's so obvious
Oh shit that was definitely intentional.
I admire the fact Anderson now has gotten Norton for 3 movies now. Norton apparently is very difficult to work with and seems like a lot of directors get sick of him. 
Also Frances McDormand and Bob Balaban.
Owen Wilson isn't involved either. Maybe they're just cat people
Was he a good dog?

Who's to say.
This will start fun then turn emotionally devastating.

Dafaq?
They're all doomed because of the dog flu... this is their last hurrah, they're going to die trying to reunite Spot with his human - a la Saving Private Ryan
Inb4 this becomes the animated dog version of Rogue One.
I was always a Cranston-doubter because I'm a huge Seinfeld fan and could only think of him as "Tim WHAT-ley," but then I binge-watched Breaking Bad in like three days and he won me over. He was fantastic as LBJ, and is pretty much a delight in everything he's in, so I'm down with adding him to the Anderson regulars. 
Oh please make this true
Absolutely. Though Wes's catalog has MANY examples of his, I think my favorite is during *Rushmore* when Herman Blume meets Max's father for the first time and realizes he's just a barber, rather than the neurosurgeon that Max told everyone he was. There's this incredible range of emotions that comes over Bill Murray's face in just a matter of seconds. It's like, he's initially confused, then shocked, then grows into this state of sympathy -- as though he completely understands WHY Max made up this lie about his father (as though it were shameful he were "only" a barber) because he struggles with the same insecurity-complex -- and finally a little twinge of joy and sincere happiness that he's *finally* meeting "THE" Mr. Fischer. 

Scene kills me every single time.

For me, nothing will ever beat the shot of Agatha on the carousel. Her love for Zero comes through so powerfully and warmly. It's just so beautiful and pure. 
Anderson is one of few directors nowadays that seems to enjoy longer takes, and some takes that appear to only be master shots with a few inserts. It's a nice change of pace from the cut-cut-cut editing and closeup shooting of Hollywood Cinema. Anderson and Yeoman (his DP) really have a great thing going in terms of cinematography and how it can be used to elicit emotions and set a tone.
Not only the directing that can coax this sort of thing from an actor and capture it on film, but the ability to pull together an ensemble of actors who can portray all of that emotion so well
Moonrise Kingdom captured the essence of childhood better than any film I've ever seen
*Nostalgia - it's delicate, but potent. Teddy told me that in Greek, "nostalgia" literally means "the pain from an old wound." It's a twinge in your heart far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a spaceship, it's a time machine. It goes backwards, and forwards... it takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It's not called the wheel, it's called the carousel. It let's us travel the way a child travels - around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know are loved.*
-Don Draper, Mad Men

I think you hit the nail right on the head.
Yep, there's no doubt about that, either. Nostalgia is a feeling that sounds so intangible on the surface, yet Wes is able to evoke that level of sentimentality effortlessly. Only other director who's come close to nailing something like that (for me, anyway) is Noah Baumbach, which kind of makes sense since Noah and Wes have worked together on several projects before.
Maybe this is why I don't care for his movies. They don't make me feel nostalgia at all. They feel like they're trying to make me feel something but it just isn't clicking, and the fact that I'm not feeling what the movie wants me to feel just leaves me feeling manipulated and frustrated. 
No. Owen would've made a fun dog, I think. 
No Schwartzman either.
Wow...
Wow
I mean Bottle Rocket came out 2 years before Rushmore so it's not too surprising Schwartzman wasn't in that one, as Rushmore was his first acting credit.
Goddamn it
*you forgot your dog you idiots!*

Not to mention, the people who work with him tend to be actors who are known for being very selective about their roles, or who are notoriously hard to pin down. And Wes gets some of their best work out of them. 

For example: Bill Murray has been in every single one of his movies since Rushmore. Even his minor performances such as in Moonrise Kingdom are fantastic. 

I’m admittedly a bit sad we won’t see Willem Dafoe as a dog. But we get Jeff Goldblum as a dog. The world can always use more Wes/Goldblum. 

And Cranston? Likely an amazing addition. 
The Grand Budapest Hotel soundtrack was in my top 10 most played albums in 2016. That album is an adventure by itself.
The tune is Sergei Prokofiev's "Lieutenant Kijé." Greg Lake features it in his song "I Believe In Father Christmas" as well.

If you get a chance to work with Wes Anderson I can’t imagine asking for a ton of movie. Every single one of his movies gives the actor a new challenging role that is so different than what they usually play.  For example Owen Wilson not type cast as a goofy love interest, Ben Stiller not being a comic foil, the list just goes on and on.  Every single movie he makes showcases its actors while using very interesting settings to enhance them without being overly distracting.

I love how you just cited some random person in the future.You're completely right, there will be a detailed and insightful explanation in due course.
On a semi-related note, the Canary Islands probably got their name out of a belief that they were inhabited by large numbers of dogs.

>The name Islas Canarias is likely derived from the Latin name Canariae Insulae, meaning "Islands of the Dogs", a name applied originally only to Gran Canaria. According to the historian Pliny the Elder, the Mauretanian king Juba II named the island Canaria because it contained "vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".[21]

I hope for exactly this as my eulogy.
It's on HBO go right now for anyone who hasn't seen it.
Spitz is never tranquilized in the film. We last see him running freely, snarling and snapping at Bean and his men who have taken refuge on a high platform out of the dog's reach.
I think its animals in general. In grand budapest a cat gets thrown out a windown and splattered. Maybe he just does it for shock value. 
That's a stretch, but I like it.
Bye cody 
I mean it's frowned upon
The sudden absurdity of that exchange always makes me laugh
No but this is much better.
That's one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. I still don't know if I liked it or not. Only watched it once. 
Dude is dating a sociopathic and sadistic bitch and pretends he's the same. She decided to kick his dog/brother to death while he was asleep. It was slow and painful death for dog-bro, but he got revenge by turning her into the worst animal possible.

But the original story was so basic.

Like, "it could've been a picture book" levels of basic.
Very different, but still such an incredible gem of a film. I would have been more bothered if the film ended up feeling like a sad approximation of the Dahl original, but it was so chock full of quirk and humor that I found myself ultimately unconcerned as too the discrepancies. Still, there's nothing like that feeling, as a kid, of reading the original with all of its exciting underground subversion of those nasty farmers.
I've been reading Dahl books with my son since he was about 4. We always watch the movies (if available) after we finish the book. We, too, were surprised.
People hit on Wes Anderson for being a bit one note and I think superficially that's maybe a tiny bit true (although not really as much as people think) but GOOD GOD what a lovely note it is.   
I remember watching The Darjeeling Limited before I knew about Wes Anderson and was bored to the tits.  I saw Fantastic Mr. Fox and loved it, bought it on DVD and still was another 5 years until I would go back and watch all of his films and come to love The Darjeeling Limited because it almost has a strange feeling to it that I can watch it over and over and over again like a few other movies:  Midnight in Paris (seen 8 or so times), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (10 times bc mostly kept seeing with friends who hadn't seen it, Spirited Away (5 times), and TDL.

Strange but I don't find any of those movies a 10/10, more likely 7 or 8/10 but I can always watch them and always feel good.
It seems there are two points of view: one of from the main dog, and one from the human girl. So from the dog's point of view, they can't understand human language but the girl's point of view (probably as narrarator) it's understandable just fine.
He's a weeb.
I'd agree with you there. Even though it's the "future", aesthetically it looks more like 1950's postwar Japan to me. It's not really the supermodern shining metropolis of Tokyo that people expect when thinking of Japan in the future.
The period of 2037?
That's still one of my favorite SNL skits of all time
No love for David Lynch?
There was a point (Darjeeling Limited) at which I started to dislike how he seemed to be veering into self-parody, but I embraced it fully with the very next movie (Fantastic Mr Fox) and ever since.
[deleted]
It helps that it's a fantastic story in general
one of my favorite movies of all time 
If what I think is happening, is happening... It better not be.
and virtually every wes anderson movie
Literally the *only* Wes Anderson movie I haven't seen. I need to rectify that.
The world building was absolutely top tier.

If there were a three hour block of side stories involving the hotel in the middle of the movie, I would still watch it. 
I thought the Norton voice was David Spade until I read your comment.
Still. Darjeeling came out in 2007, then Mr. Fox in 2009. But I understand though. I don't mind waiting for Wes to craft his beautiful films! 
Sausage party *
Everyone said it when Grand Budapest trailer came out.

And they weren't wrong
And every time it is true.
Moonrise Kingdom was pretty damn Wes Anderson-y
Infinity War will be my go-to when that comes out
Some people say that Brian Cranston is always playing Hal, he's just playing a version of Hal that is pretending to be someone else.
But Japan? The future? Non-anthropomorphic talking animals? That's all new territory. It's more like something a Wes Anderson character would write, which yeah, in a way is the most Wes Anderson ever.

Considering the Baumbach connection, too.
All I want is a scene where a dog played by Wilson says"wow" instead of barking

Considering it starts with exiling dogs to trash island, I'm not so sure about it starting fun. Best we can hope for is a fun middle i think.
I mean have you heard her sing? She already sounds like a dying mutt.

Malcom in the Middle, too man

Exactly! Another poignant scene is in *Moonrise Kingdom*, when Bill Murray's and Bruce Willis' characters are driving at night, in a state of emergency about Murray's characters missing daughter, and Bruce asks Bill how his wife is taking it, calling her by her first name.

"How's so-and-so?"

Bill Murray doesn't answer his question, and I believe responds with one of his own-

"What's it matter to you?"

Bruce doesn't answer, he just falls quiet. A look of understanding and remorse falls on Bill Murray's face as it literally falls into shadow. That scene holds for a good few seconds.
"I'm a little bit lonely these days" *while smoking 2 cigarettes at the same time*

my all time favourite scene in film history.
It's beautiful because a simple haircut and hot shave is exactly what Herman needs in that moment, too. 

"Now do you wanna keep that mustache?"

That's the most interesting and mature response I've seen to someone not liking Wes Anderson movies. 

While I absolutely love his movies, I can clearly see where you're coming from and appreciate it.
Seriously, wtf Anderson? Owen is the most doggiest of all the usual cast. 
Wow.
He would have made the best dog. Least he was in Fantastic Mr. Fox. 
*Whhaaaaoooowww*
There was poor little Buckley Tenenbaum...
There is an animal death in Grand Budapest Hotel.

Came expecting Berry face. Was not disappointed.

When a genius director casts someone terrible, just have faith they did it for a good reason, just look at Punch Drunk Love.
You know while I was typing I was super tempted to put that. But I wanted to be informative.
Ha!!! He was actually really nice and we were friends (on the downlow) despite our popularity difference. I retained a crush on him for many years. Like 10 years later, I ran into him again as he was working the drive through of McDonald's and I admit I was a little pleased to see that the dorky girl had gone farther career-wise than the cute popular boy.  Then I felt guilty for feeling that way. Ha!  
Nah the kid has a black eye.  But he's also in Plisken role crash landing his plane on the island.

I got about 1/2 way through and it really started to lose me, is the ending worth a revisit? 
You better not be cussing with me you little cuss. 
It was a real cluster cuss out there. 
I was wondering what you guys were talking about, but I always thought that was french toast. It looks like it has a crust and it's the exact coloring as the cooked egg wash of french toast. I'm so confused.
I know, but I just loved the solution they came to in the book. I went in expecting the story to be fleshed out more; I wasn't expecting them to come to the end of the book halfway through the movie, and for the ending of the book to be immediately undercut.
I would sternly suggest watching the better, objectively stronger Wes Anderson narratives like The Royal Tenebaums, The Life Aquatic, and The Grand Budapest Hotel.  And then proceed to Moonrise Kingdom and Rushmore.  No one quite does lovable, quirky characters like WA.
You should watch The Life Aquatic, The Grand Budapest hotel or Moonrise Kingdom, you probably picked the most.....i dont know if controversial would be the word but the least Anderson-ish of his movies. 
I would assume there'll be a mirrored scene from the girls point of view where they can't understand a dog.
what's that?
ONE OF US
My personal favorite period.
Edward Norton does a great Owen Wilson.
It's a great cussing story and a great cussing movie.
Honestly, I think it is his crowning achievement. I know that is blasphemous to some (and I don't say it as a criticism of his other works, which I love), but it is, to me, the perfect execution and application of Wes Anderson's style. 
I can't overstate how solid it is. I've seen it probably fifteen or twenty times. That, Good Will Hunting, and Eternal Sunshine are my go-to movies when I want to watch something but I can't figure out what. 
Seriously do it. Its an amazing film.
I thought the same thing, I kept picturing Kuzco 
The most Wes Andersony Wes Anderson movie has to be a life aquatic. No one else could have made that movie.
It's Wes Andersons all the way down. 
Grand Budapest had at least three layers of framing device, including a book. 
One of my favourite SNL bits in years. "The Murderers" having their own letterhead and "Picture of Edith Piaf" get me every time.
Is it just me or is the guy with the cleaver and vintage record player actually Wes Anderson?

Pretty sure that’s him. The hair is a giveaway. 
I wish it were real.... this would work great as a Wes Anderson movie
Oh wow. This is glorious. Thank you for sharing.

"I had a rough night at the bar last night so I'm going to put this movie on because no one wants to be teaching you little fucks right now. So watch this movie while I sit here and die."
At what point in the film is Spitz, the rabid dog, tranquilized by a laced blueberry?
I've seen the film many, many times and I don't recall Spitz ever being tranquilized.
The beagles guarding Boggis's property are tranquilized during a heist. Bean's rabid dog Spitz chases Mr. Fox after Kylie fails to produce a blueberry when Mr. Fox demands one, despite the fact that Kylie has a reminder written on his palm.
Spitz is later used by Ash as a diversion. The heroes escape while the dog chases the villains.
Spitz doesn't appear in the film until Mr. Fox and company go to Bean Annex to rescue Kristofferson, and he doesn't appear again after chasing Bean and his henchmen.
He never consumes a blueberry because there are no blueberries for him to consume.

TL;DR
YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT AN INSIGNIFICANT DETAIL IN A MOVIE, RANDOM INTERNET PERSON. ABOVE IS A LENGTHY EXPLANATION OF HOW YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

Yes. I stuck with it and really enjoyed the ending, it made the whole first half of the movie worth it. 
*angry badger noises*
That is 100% french toast. Pancakes have a more solid color to them.
As someone who didn't read the book, I thought Fantastic Mr. Fox was amazingly well done and a near perfect film, including plot. So I don't know, maybe Anderson changed it to perfect it? We should allow him that freedom, I suppose.
Royal tenenbaums, Rushmore are his undisputed masterpieces. Life aquatic was awesome too, and I need to give Darjeeling a second time. It didn’t click when I saw it in theatres

You know why Wes can make a movie that great and still fly under the radar when all the other film companies come out with these big budget movies?

Because he's little.
I read that in Clooney's voice.
You could say that for literally every Wes Anderson movie I feel. I mean who else could do Moonrise Kingdom? 
without a doubt the royal tenenbaums is the most wes andersony film. AH FUCK IT THEY'RE ALL WES ANDERSONY AND WE LOVE IT!
God I love that movie, something about it, every scene is great
Still my favorite one by him. 

I just don't know how anyone else could have made that movie what it was.
It’s my favorite Wes movie. I remember being 11, having just moved to a new country, 6 months without going to school, bored out of my mind, was the first time I saw it. I was like “what is this?!” I was so enthralled and fell in love with Wes Anderson’s style since then
Time to Wes down your Andersons
He's [commented on it before](http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-wes-anderson-interview-20140312-column.html) and his opinion is mixed, so I doubt he was involved.

Pretty common reaction 
It was a total jerk thought to have. But in context, although nice, he wouldn't go out with me bc I was unpopular, which really hurt for a long time, and he never stuck up for me in front of other kids (junior high was just brutal overall with a lot of really cruel kids so it would have been a big deal if he'd done that - in retrospect I understand popularity is tenuous and it could have hurt his reputation to do so, so I stopped holding it against him a long time ago). So seeing him working there made me momentarily have a little "HA!" moment, which luckily only lasted a moment and it didn't end my crush on him;  he was still adorable. And we've talked since and he's doing great and I'll always have a bit of a crush on him. (I was dating someone when I saw him working or I totally would have tried again.)

That's fair. I just thought that the resolution in the book was a better situation for the characters involved than the resolution in the movie.
I don't know if it was included in the theatrical release, but I highly recommend watching the short film "Hotel Chevalier" before and/or after The Darjeeling Limited. Adds another small layer of depth with Jason Schwartzman's character.
