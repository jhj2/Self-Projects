Well, there goes the Avatar box office record.
My mothers gonna love this.
Ahh, I see they're going the Godafther II route with this one. . . 
Said this before and will say again:
Mamma Mia wasn't just a movie in the UK - it was a phenomenon - people would go back and see it again and again and again for months. The world is a miserable place at the moment so I'm looking forward to escaping and returning to that overload of positivity.
I’m sure Meryl Streep’s characters mom was dead in the first film. The power of Cher. 
The first film is truly harmless, well meaning stuff. Nothing sinister about it whatsoever. So why does my blood begin to boil whenever I think back to Brosnan belting out SOS??
So Cher had Meryl Streep when she was five?
is that... CHER?!?!
So... I'm just gonna say it, I'm actually kinda a huge fan of Abba... Should I watch the first Mamma Mia!? And then should I see Mamma Mia 2?
Did they cast Stellan Skarsgard's son as a younger version of himself?
Missed opportunity to stick one of Stellan Skarsgård’s many sons in there as his younger self. Hell, one of them is even already *named* Bill.
I really hope the guy playing young Pierce also can't sing. 
Looking forward to the Mama Mia cinematic universe.
Question: Are they reusing the same songs?
I'm definitely the target audience for this so I'm hyped!
Isn’t Cher the same age as Meryl Streep?
MRW I see this https://i.imgur.com/nqvqjo5.gifv
\*me before watching this trailer*

"I didn't really like the first one 100% so I probably won't watch this one."

\*me right after I finish watching the trailer*

"Fuck"
Pierce Brosnan is gonna sing again. lmao
I'll watch Lily James in anything, so count me in.
Cher is Meryl Streep’s mom?? WAT?
I saw the original with my ex wife and I couldn't believe just how my opinion shifted and I absolutely liked it a lot. Its one of my guilty pleasure movies. 
It’s the homosexual in me but I cannot wait for this.
This time, featuring music from DMX. 

I grew up listening to Abba and just like the first movie, I can see myself singing the tunes during the 2nd one. 


This is the definition of harmless cinema imo. Its a fun, relatively family safe, film. I won't see it in theaters, but I will catch it on Netflix or whatever I'm sure. 
[deleted]
Can't believe this is being made, the first is one of those so bad it's good films for me. [This review by Kermode is gold.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61UolzFTVPI)
Can't wait, loved the first movie. If it's another camp fest I'm already there. 
Wtf they think they are some kind of Godfather Part 2 of musical movie?
Moms around the world are losing their mind right now...and as well they should, the original is the perfect mom movie, fun and harmless (and ABBA). 
MOTHERS.BE.AWARE
As a man who loves ABBA, and hates Mamma Mia!...

I am impressed by this trailer. 

The concept for this sequel looks well executed.

Lilly James is awesome and apparently sings (or autotunes I can't tell) well.

When I heard they were doing this I was skeptical thinking they'd do something half-assed that took place after, and that they'd avoid the previously used ABBA songs.

Godspeed ladies and gay men, godspeed.
My wife loves the original movie, but I don't know how she will feel about Meryl Streep's character being dead.
The origin story we all waited for!
[deleted]
That's gonna be a no for me dog
*Shudder*
Here we go again. Yay.
I bet there are a lot of middle aged women who are going to have some wine and enjoy the shit out of this movie. 
The first one is a perfect cold weather movie. This one will probably be the same. Harmless, guilty pleasure kind of movie. 
i was just thinking to myself how another mamma mia release wouldnt effect me 
Oh no, here we go again
They're going for the current popular format, bring in a bunch of cheap younger actors to do most of the film, tie it together with part of the old cast returning. It's a 'sequel' but it's not got a number and the plot will be nearly the same. 
How can they kill off Meryl Streep?! She was one of the only things salvageable about the first movie. Pierce Brosnan murdering S.O.S was iconic, but I hope to high heavens he isn't given any musical numbers this time around... 
Count me out, boys. 
I'm quite excited to see Amanda Seyfried in a musical. Finally showing off her talent instead of baring her flesh on movies.
Hmmm
Well the first one was nice.
This is apparently [lifting exact jokes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcSMdhfKga4&t=114) from [Sports Night.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFKDJPdhMYU&t=8)
Oh its a prequel! 
Why has this trailer left me so confused. I honestly have no idea whats going on here
Ah yes, the next film in Legendary’s Godzilla cinematic universe.
Why...just why?
Oh hell...I'm not looking forward to my wife subjecting me to this. The first one was bad enough.
I love Mamma Mia so I'm excited.
Oh uh, sorry mom! I'll be to busy to go to the theater during its entire theatrical run!
How did they manage to make a two minute trailer feel six minutes long. 
Here we go again...again.
I thought this was a Mario and Captain Underpants crossover
I forgot they are making of a sequel/prequel of Mamma Mia with Lily James who is known for Cinderella $1 u/tippr
I forgot they are making of a sequel/prequel of Mamma Mia with Lily James who is known for Cinderella $1 u/tippr
Hope the love interest is called fernando
Okay, first; huge fan of Mamma Mia.  Grew up listening to ABBA thanks to my parents, love the music, love the film, especially the beautiful scenery.

That being said; Mamma Mia 2? The absolute most unnecessary  sequel ever to come out of, well, anywhere.  


So is she still with her husband or boyfriend or whatever? Cause she says she doesn't know how she'll do it alone but her husband/boyfriend shows up later in the trailer...
I really wanted to be excited for this but seeing that it's managed to get so much wrong in terms of continuity then how can it really be that good? The "young" dads look nothing like what Meryl's photos in the first film had them look like. Also why are Julie Walters and Christine Baranski telling her of what her mother went through when they didn't know the whole story in the last movie? Overall I feel like the script is probably going to brush over any continuity problems with a big song number
Why did this need a sequel again?
Again..?
Did anyone even ask for this?!? 
No.
colin firth worked with woody allen

pierce brosnan worked with roman polanski

meryl knew about weinstein 
The film absolutely no one was asking for!
At least in Scandinavia. *Mamma Mia* is the most seen film at cinemas in Norway for the last 10 years! Beating *Avatar*, *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* and many others.

1,1 million tickets sold (*Avatar* sold 700.000, which is still an impressive number). Norway's entire population is 5 million people.
Everyone’s mother is going to love this 
I absolutely loved the first one and I bet Im gonna enjoy this one as well.

27, male, no shame
[deleted]
My mother's gonna hate it.  

My sister, however, will love it and will drag our mother to it.  She will then cry through the whole thing.  And our mother will have to pretend that she liked it because she doesn't want to upset my sister,

Donna Corleone  :)


Mamma Mia: Origins
Mamma Mia 3 with Sofia Coppola singing ?
Is that good or bad, in your opinion?
Did they have the "sing-along" version at the theaters (karaoke style with the song lyrics)? My wife and daughter probably saw it five times at the theater and we've bought two copies of the DVD because the first one somehow got scratched. 
It was the highest grossing film in the box office between 2000-2009.  
Considering most of the Harry Potter films also came out during that time, that's an achievement. 
It's on ITV all the time and I haven't met a person who doesn't like it. I was so surprised when I found out that it was trashed by critics.
Yep! Mamma Mia! in general seems to come out at a miserable time. The broadway show debuted a month after 9/11. The first one came out at the end of the Bush presidency (no one knew if the republicans would get back in again) and the financial crisis. The sequel is coming out during the Trump presidency. 
The best films released are the ones targeted at the middle aged/elderly people, because they're all so respectful and clean
Oh yeah, that might be right. I am very positive I won't like the bits with Cher. And why are they trying to keep the pregnancy a secret I wonder.
Do you belieeeeeeeeeeeeeeve in life after death?
And wasn't *she* a ray of sunshine.
Is that who that walking silicone dummy was?
Brosnan's shout-singing is my favourite thing about the first one. 
I think that might be might favourite part of the first one.

Oh kind of like Russell Crowe's Javert
Mamma Mia! was not harmless, it was by far the worst thing to ever happen to Greece, like ever. Absolutely ever, nothing worse ever happened.  
The first one was utter hot garbage. And I saw it when I was a stupid kid so you know that means it's extra bad.
When she was three, actually! 
I mean, it's no worse than the ages of the Golden Girls.
I thought she was Lady Gaga before she took off the sunglasses
ABBA fucking rules.
The first one was good and fun. Except for Pierce Brosnan's singing voice. I really like the movie and it was basically my introduction to ABBA. I think an ABBA fan would also like it, considering one of the Bs from ABBA was a consultant or something. Hope you don't think you favorite songs butchered, but I really liked the first one.

This one, though, seems a bit forced. But I'll be there the opening night.
Yeah aside from some questionable singing from time to time, I think they do a good job portraying the songs into the story and its musical numbers. 
You should definitely watch it! 

It's a perfect feel-good movie, with a fantastic cast and a great soundtrack (obviously).

I didn't know how much I loved Abba until I saw the movie.
Do you want all your favourite melodies forever associated with people who don't sound as good as Abba singing them?  

If so, then yes ;)
It’s total cheese but really enjoyable. And I actually kind of prefer Meryl’s version of ‘Winner takes it all’ but it’s Meryl Streep so thats kind of cheating. 
You should.  It's fun and always makes me happy.  
you should see Mamma Mia as a play like it was meant to, and then buy the DVD, head to a lake and wait for the sun to start setting. Pull out the DVD, lay your fingers across it's logo printed on it, flip it over, gaze into your reflection. Place it close to your heart and breath deep, then fling it as hard as you can and see how many times it will skip across the pond into oblivion.

Then post here for karma.

The first film is absolute rubbish, but it's genuinely enjoyable and that's because of the ABBA songs. 
Yup and i don't understand why not cast one of the two Meryl streep's daughters as younger Meryl, they were amazing in [The good wife](https://imgur.com/KR2Ma5c) and [Mr Robot](https://imgur.com/Wiu6skX). 
No. They do look really similar, tho.
Holy shit I just made the connection for the first time that Stellan Skarsgard's children are Alexander and Bill Skarsgard.

What a fucking family.
Wait until Ace of Base movies. It will be marvel vs dc in the nordic markets.
Some. It'll be a few of the biggest tracks and then loads of other (new) ones.
I too am human
happy cake day
Cher is ageless.
That James Bond money is running out.
She's just a delight in everything she's been in. Downton Abbey, Cinderella, Baby Driver...
The power of musicals. ❤️
oh man, i need to become a hollywood producer so that I can make a cheesy romantic jukebox musical with a soundtrack of oldschool hiphop. it'd be so ridiculous but amazing. 
Has there ever been a musical featuring rap songs? Someone should get on that ASAP. 
There is a shot of her performing with Julie Walters with white hair. So we know she's in the movie.
Kill off who? She's alive.
Oh wow, I don't think I'd seen this review before. Love Kermode, that might be my new favourite review of his.
Wait, the first one came out in 2008? Why the fuck did I think it came out in the '90s? Jesus, I think I have some kind of mandela effect shit going on right now...
Probably my favourite Kermode review ever. I've watched it so many times. 
> Why would you do a sequel to Mamma Mia! and have Meryl Streep come back in a cameo?

I don't think it's a cameo. I think it'll be half in the present and half being told through flashbacks. Based on the trailer it seems like Amanda Seyfried's character learns how to handle her pregnancy because of hearing her mother's story? Although I wonder why her being pregnant needs to be secret.

When I heard it was going to be a prequel I was worried, but this actually seems like it balances the old cast with the new quite well. 
Yeah a prequel is definitely pointless, I wanted to see more of the original cast which was a big part of the success of the first movie 
I mean...I agree with you, but I’m not against either of those things.
Heat flashes
This isn't really the movie where you're suppose to care about those things.  This movie is made to sing-along and just be a bit more distracted than turning on the Greatest Hits album of ABBA
Yes.
We all knew about Weinstein. It was kind of a pretty well known ""sectret"" that he was a serial rapist
What the actual fuck.
Tell me about it. I have a bunch of relatives who saw it 4-5 times in the theatre. I think I saw it twice. 
Wow... seriously? i guess just for the Abba sound track... but honestly, that movie was brutal as fuck.. I've seen the play, and it was really good, far better than I expected, my wife absolutely loved the play.

Watching the movie, we struggled to get through it, it was just awful.

Ehhhh my mom does not care for this sort of thing. How dare you generalize all mothers!
Not mine.  She's dead.
Mothers be aware!
My grandma hated the first one!
But *does your mother know?*
And absolutely no one else is going to love this

> EDIT: Seems I've underestimated Mamma Mia fans, just ignore me
My mom thinks it's dumb to make a sequel because they already used all the iconic abba songs in the first film.
and Pierce Brosnan is an excellent vocalist....

/s

GET HER TO SEW DAT!
Good luck at Christmas. 
My condolences.
Is that where Wolverine shows up?
She gets shot in the end.
Yeah they did the sing along version in UK cinemas - not sure about other countries though.
> somehow got scratched  
somehow
While we've not met in person... I'm one that wants this movie to die a horrible horrible death.

I work in dementia specific aged care, I appreciate that the first movie has some dementia keep calm mojo going on, (seriously though, the residents love it and just sit calmly, smiling). I must have seen it at least 40 times in the past year... kill me!!!

I jest of course, but it's legitimately broken me haha! That and Sound of Music and Andre Rieu, (AKA: He who must not be played).
I don’t know. They seem like they’re still together. It looks like Donna has passed away. 
plastic surgery is a helluva drug
My favorite part is how we crucified Chris Klein and his high and awful singing when Bronson was just as bad.
I'm not going to lie, I don't skip SOS when I'm listening to the soundtrack
AHHHGFFF. MAKE IT STOP. 
Is that Kree?
Gotta hate the movie *big time* to put it above that economic crisis Greece had. 
Mamma mia!!!
That moment when you find out Sophia was actually younger than Dorothy in real life. 
Now we need a movie where Lady Gaga plays a young Cher.
same!
I thought she was an animatronic barbie doll
I was watching an interview with the Foo Fighters, and they talked about how they consider ABBA, without a doubt, the greatest pop group of all time. It made me dig into their albums a bit, and man am I hooked. Even the shittiest movie seems to be improved with ABBA music in it. 
SOS vs Good Vibrations for Greatest Pop Tune of All Time
[deleted]
We can forgive Pierce's singing voice cause he seems like he was really putting in so much effort. 

I remember when Abba was popular in the 70s.  Almost like they were the Beatles, but not quite. 

I remember my sister belting out Does your momma know..... on the record player (Yes, record player) waking every body up. 

I think my favorite Abba tune was Super-trouper. 


I known someone who loves ABBA and liked them less because of the movie.

Surprisingly, I thought Colin Firth was quite good singing "Our Last Summer". 


Story time. When I was 7 my best friend and I were at an amusement park with her mother. Her mother was a massive helicopter parent and germaphobe. Mother really needs to poop and both us children need to pee. We find an empty bathroom and the mother starts piling tissues on the floor. She makes three little mounds of TP and towelettes and squats down and takes a shit right in the middle of the bathroom. My eyes bulge but my friend nonchalantly goes and starts peeing on her mound of tp. I go in a cubicle like a human being and get shouted at for being disgusting by my friend's mum, who is still shitting and pissing right in the open. The two of them then just leave these completely soggy, rancid piles of tp in the middle of the bathroom and leave without washing their hands, and stand outside using hand sanitiser and the mum gets a can of dettol spray and sprays it all over us. Despite that she didn't let me sit too close to her daughter because I was covered in toilet germs. She also stopped her daughter from ever seeing me again because like two months after this the daughter caught a cold and it was my fault because I carry toilet germs.
I sometimes wonder how that girl turned out...
Oh uh good idea, but I just watched the movie instead. It was bad but I was singing-along the whole time so overall it wasn't a bad time. 
The pretence of holding together a plot through 30 year old unrelated songs allows for a lot of leeway.

Harmless fun. Middle Aged women everywhere will watch this and down bottles of wine to this sequel for years to come.
I must admit though, Lilly James looks a lot like Amanda Seinfried (sp?). Good casting on that part. 
DOM IS MERYL STREEPS DAUGHTER?!
She maybe can't sing.
Can they sing? Not that half the cast can sing but I feel like the movie hinges on the fact that younger Meryl can sing. 
Damn had no idea those were streep's daughters... although the resemblance is definitely there.

A fifth-dimensional being 
Hamilton, In the Heights.
The way they're talking about her makes it seem like she's dead
They have clearly killed her off. Kind of a baffling decision.
Lol the 90's? I'm 19 and if somebody asked me when it came out I would've thought 2010
Maybe she doesn't know who the father is?
I just want to hear Pierce Brosnan butcher ABBA songs, is that too much to ask for? 
Yeah it's especially pointless when we know exactly how it resolves itself. There's no mystery to it. 
Why not both right? :)
Sorry but I don't let that be an excuse. The first was a great movie for what it was, told a complete story all while featuring Abba songs. The second has only managed to include Abba songs as far as I can tell
> We all knew about Weinstein

we all know about woody allen
Abba are from Sweden... Wait he's talking about Norway, um
its those oil fumes they huff on daily bases. 
Yeah. Even though ABBA is Swedish, Sweden is our neighbouring country and we swallow up everything about it. I find it interesting seeing my own country's box office and comparing it with the North American or worldwide. For instance, *Spectre* was a bigger hit than *The Force Awakens* (in general, James Bond does extremely well in Norway). Or the most watched American film in cinemas of 2016 here is not *Rogue One*, *The Jungle Book*, *Captain America: Civil War* or *Batman v. Superman*. No, it's the romantic drama *Me before You* with Emilia Clarke. Crazy!

Every year, the majority of the top 5 movies are Norwegian blockbusters (which can explain *Mamma Mia*'s hit). Seeing Norwegian blockbusters on top is also a surprise, since that wasn't the case 15 years ago and earlier.
I would never do that, especially not on your...


[ turns on the lights to reveal family & friends ]

** HAPPY CAKE DAY!!! **
My wife is a mother, and hated the first movie, as did I.
Great, she's the target demo for this one!
There are dozens of us!
They’re in for a scare 
I can appreciate a musical and a feelgoodmovie from time to time. Yet i would not go to the cinema for it.
What have you got against ABBA?
I'm definitely not a mother and I really like the first one
They still have. Went to one in June. It was SO MUCH FUN!!!
We had it here in the US, too. 

That's what the comments are saying in YouTube.  I guess this is why there are flashbacks? 


This seems like a depressing thing in such a feel-good film.
[deleted]
That is the joke.

(they had the Sack of Constantinople, the Conquest, Bavarocrazia (meaning they got independence from the Ottomans came with....German rule), the loss of Asia Minor and the loss of 4,000 year old presence there, WW2, the Civil War and the brain drain afterwards, the dicatorship AND THEN the financial crisis, TLDR, Greek history is pretty terrible)

EDIT: More terrible stuff: Sparta conquering Athens destroying one of the coolest societies ever, the mere existence of that shithole Sparta, the continuous infighting in the ancient era, the Huns, the Avars, the Bulgars, the Slavs (especially the biggest enemy for some millenia, the Bulgarians up to last century), the [Catalans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_campaign_in_Asia_Minor), the Normans (leading to the GrecoRomans having to defend the West and losing a lot of the East to the Seljuks), those dumb wars with Persia that led to their weakening and losing North Africa to Arab expansion...

EDIT 2: [Forgot the Hungarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_invasions_of_Europe). 
Hmm but do we really?
James Hetfield of Metallica said that he and his family listens to ABBA in the car because it's one of the few things they all agree is good.
He tried. That's the main thing. 
ABBA did top the charts several times in the 70s, so they were pretty much the beatles of that decade.
Man that is my favourite song off the movie, and then Pierce comes in after Colin's sweet soft voice and it's like whyyyyyyyy
What?
Also good they chose [Tarzan Skarsgard](https://imgur.com/VTvT9wQ) and not [Pennywise Skarsgard](https://imgur.com/4bmCzRl) or [Viking Skarsgard](https://imgur.com/4LKHgj4). 

EDIT: It's actually [Josh Dylan](https://imgur.com/Od9wjHH) but hey he could pass being the 4th Skarsgard sibling.
I just don’t see her as a young Streep. Her singing style in particular is really different. I guess continuity isn’t exactly important for this kind of film though.
*Seyfried
> Lily James

Fuck...I thought that was Alicia Vikander the whole time during the trailer.

There’s definitely some family resemblance.
MERYL STREEP’S DAUGHTER IS A JERSEY GIRL?
She dies in the first act and becomes "Donna the White".
I think she's suffering from high blood pressure or something like that, and on bed rest. They keep the pregnancy a secret so she doesn't go batshit and die.
Here we go again!
um, you mean east sweden right?
😄😄😄 thanks!
Id have to be asleep on an airplane and have this accidentally come on for me to "watch" it. Technically, I am also in this coveted demo. #swish
I like ABBA, doesn't mean I have to like a sequel to a movie based on a play that uses ABBA songs.
Probably. Meryl did about a week of filming. I wonder if that’s all she wanted to do so they wrote the story around her or this is the story they came up with and didn’t need her 
That´s because the caliber of Les Mis gave Crowe the scrutiny whereas this film was small enough to disappear and not taint Brosnan.
I’ll never get this. Crowe nailed what he and the director were going for and his voice was a highlight for me *because* of how it stood out. 
you're javert?
AND I'M JAVERT!
I'm still gonna say yes, at least in theory.
Yes. 100% yes.
I'm a fucking metalhead, through and through but ABBA is fucking insanely great. Toto, is, too.
And therefore, noone should criticize him!
after all, isn't that all we ever want in professional performances where the actor is making millions.... they tried... pat on the backs for everyone!

The Beatles had an insane 27 #1 hits tho ;)
I don't know what trailer you guys were watching but that is not Alexander Skarsgard...
wtf, how many are there?!
Are you saying that Cher is an advanced form of Meryl Streep? 
Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight?
My, my
West sweden
Don't you judge musicals on the songs?
Definitely the former. I feel like if you can get Meryl Streep, you use Meryl Streep. 
I thought the visuals of Les Mis were amazing, the acting was great. I'm not much for singing, but Hugh Jackman's voice is amazing... Then there was tone deaf Crowe... urghghghg..

it's like the Movie was hitting 11 across the board, and Crowe starts to sing, and you can just hear the rusty breaks squealing to a halt as it drops down to a 6/10

[deleted]
I didn’t realize he and the director were going for a classic cotton balls in the mouth sound
No one should be *mean.* Criticism definitely has its place. 
Yea. ABBA only had 9. But this wasn't really a competition. :p

I would argue that the more important aspect is the fact that when an ABBA song comes on, everyone dances and sings. Can you say the same for the beatles? Basically, beatles and ABBA both made amazing songs. But the ones ABBA made lasted for longer and will probably last for a long time coming.
The Beatles we're truly The Beatles of their era.
Thank you I thought I was going insane. That's Josh Dylan playing young Bill
Nobody really knows.
Stellan Skarsgård has 8 kids- 7 sons, 1 daughter
I judge musicals like I judge a movie, songs are just an additional major thing I have to take into consideration. I can say that the songs from the 2017 Beauty and the Beast remake are pretty great, but that doesn't mean the rest of the movie is too.

>EDIT: Also La La Land is one of my favourite movies, and that's a great movie with great songs through and through. Basically my point is for me to judge something fairly, I have to take everything into consideration, not just "I like the soundtrack". If that were the case I would be praising Suicide Squad.
He was so bad. I was like, "Nobody else could have done this role?" Hell, just slip in Banderas and call it day!
I am now remembering Sacha Baron-Cohen and Helena Bonham-Carter were in that movie.
[the reference](http://www.reactiongifs.us/i-tried-and-therefore-no-one-should-criticize-me-daniel-radcliffe/)
I don't see how dancing makes a song inherently better aha, and oh jeez you are seriously gonna state stuff like The Beatles not standing the test of time? 
It's Skarsgards all the way down.
Isn’t the youngest still like 6 years old as well or something? 
Suicide squad is kinda exempt because its not a musical... 

I've not seen beauty and beast 2017
Beatles songs will definitely stand the test of time out of a pure musical aspect.

But I definitely believe ABBA will outlive the Beatles when it comes to how many people recognise them and partake in themself. 

It is already the case nowadays. Go to a regular bar, Put on "Lucy in the sky with diamonds", or "when I'm sixty-four" and see how many people recognize the songs, and then out on mamma Mia, honey honey, dancing queen etc, and see how many recognize either of them.
"We're all Skarsgards down here!"
Yeah. He had the six oldest with his first wife and then the two little ones with the second wife. The most interesting aspect about the whole thing is that his oldest kid (Alexander) is 41 and his youngest is 5.
Lol I know, just an example of what I meant.

Also I would say just watch the original Beauty and the Beast again, the new one is only differentiated because it was filmed in live action, and added on another half hour worth of content.
You chose random Beatles songs over the most popular ABBA songs lmao. ABBA is a great pop group with great singles but the Beatles were insanely influential and have literally five masterpiece albums, countless hits, more plays on Spotify despite only being added in 2015.
I’d happily float with the Skarsgards. Stupid sexy vikings. 
Those were just examples, but IMO not really random. Lucy in the sky with diamonds is a song that, in my opinion, everyone should be able to recognize.

But you can pick better songs for the experiment if you want to do one, as I said, they were just examples.
