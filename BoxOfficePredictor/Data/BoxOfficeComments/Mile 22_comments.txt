Iko Uwais is my man
The fact it's Peter Berg should sell everyone. I don't care what anyone says, even his bad films were enjoyable. 
Lauren Cohen trying to advance her career. 
Mark Wahlberg playing Mark Wahlberg in a movie very much for Mark Wahlberg to be in.

Malkovich genius as usual
I think a trailer has never been better engineered to make me never want to see a movie.
This trailer sold me a lot more than the first one did.  This looks absolutely brutal, can't wait.
Came here to say the same. Iâ€™m hoping for a lot of top notch hand to hand combat scenes with him.
I don't think he's made a bad movie. I don't remember much about Hancock, but I don't remember hating it. I do remember liking, sometimes loving, the rest of his filmography.

Grew up watching Shocker on repeat too. 
Iko Uwais should trump any reason not to see this movie.


Haaaaa was thinking this looks like a terrible movie
If the trailer is anything to go by, I think we're in for a treat.  I just hope we get some longer cuts, with Iko, you've got the advantage of someone who can actually kick some ass, I hope Berg takes advantage of that and lets the action breathe a bit.  
People really hated battleship. Considering it was based on a game I didn't think it was that bad. 
It's definitely not his best work but it was still a fun time. Probably near the bottom of the list though.
