Early contender for worst movie of the year.

Ah the old Kevin Hart starring as Kevin Hart movie
wow, Kevin Hart movies are usually hit or miss, but this one looks *really* awful.

>from the director of Girls Trip

oh, that actually explains a lot...
Looks pretty terrible in my opinion. Wish he'd do more Jumanji style comedy
Two very annoying voices in one film.  Whatâ€™s not to like?
What's your favorite Kevin Hart movie? Idk why, but I usually enjoy them lmao 
i wouldn't say it's a "favorite", but i did enjoy Central Intelligence.
