Another all black cast movie where the punchline of all the jokes is a sassy black person noise. 

I have seen this film already thanks 
Wait.... this is legit a movie? I literally haven’t seen any promotion for this.
They’re really trying to push this Tiffany Haddish person
Mmmmmhhhhmmmmm.  

Haddish is quickly burning through her sudden cache with this crap. 
I guess you can say you are nobody's fool.
