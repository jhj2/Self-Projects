The first one was surprised me and I hope the sequel is as good as the first one.
These films are a real treat for the eyes. To reiterate my opinion from the first go-round, Paddington Bear is impressively animated and perfectly cast. No alarm bells at first glance; this nice little teaser gives me a good feeling that the sequel will be charming and funny like its predecessor.

I'm not sure if I can bear the extra wait until January for the US release. The first one is my favorite movie.
Had no idea they were making this. The first one was a lovely and endearing movie, the kind I don't see too often. Plus it has Dr Who.
yooooo my niggas back
I'm a ok with this. I saw the first one a few months ago and I fell in love. It's so heart felt. I can't wait to see this one!
I will endeavor to eat a marmalade sandwich in honor of this movie.
I went to see the first one just out of pure boredom, and ended up loving it. What a sweet little movie.

If the sequel keeps that tone, I'm excited.

Looks great!

I was really surprised at how nice the first one was. Instant Christmas classic in our house.

What kind of bear is Paddington?
Good news! I liked the first one and as a huge fan of Paddington as a child, it really impressed me. This one looks good.
Who doesn't love two hours some of the most charming characters ever. I couldn't do anything but smile through the first.

What is going on in this thread?  Everyone knows /r/movies doesn't like movies.
Paddington should be stop motion produced by Aardman
The first one was decent. If you take history into account, this one will be shit and will make shit money, right?
Nobody asked for this and still they made it
yo milking this shit series yo fuck off yo 
FUCK. I FUCKING HATE PADDINGTON! THIS IS BULLSHIT. FUCK FUCK FUCK THIS!
Let the sequel hype begin!
Mark Kermode compared it to Mary Poppins which I thought was a bit much, at least until I saw it. 
I honestly thought it was going to be horrible and was pleasantly shocked by just how good it was. It's a really charming, witty, and warm film.

I think it's easily one of the best children's or family films made this decade.
I just saw it yesterday here in the UK. It's not only as good as the first one, it's better!
I see what you did bear, er, there.
Yeah.  A sequel people do want?  Amazing what they'll come up with in Hollywood these days.

Spectacled bear. He doesn't really look like one, but he's from Peru, and that's the only species of bear that lives there.
There are already stop motion Paddington shorts. Not sure Paddington suits Aardman's humour. The new movie however seemed a good translation of the Paddington stories onto the big screen and found a balance between the charm and nature of the original stories with the expectations of a cinema audience. 
But they've only made one. I can't see how you can milk it if there's only one movie.

I believe the first one will go down in history as a family film staple like *Mary Poppins*.
Yikes, that pun was a bit grizzly.
Isn't this a UK Production?
Deepest, darkest Peru
