Those wigs wow
I expected a terrible trailer... Pleasantly surprised. 
I love it, I’m glad that we got badass Jennifer back. She really worked hard to establish herself as an action Star with Alias.
 Then Elektra happened and either her Hollywood or both got spooked. Glad to see that she got her groove back. 
Way better than I expected. Especially after the first 15 seconds made me think it was a Family / Holiday film.

So this is The Punisher, right? Family even accidentally get killed at the park in the crossfire of a gun battle
I just finished watching Love, Simon before seeing this trailer, and all I could think about was how great it would be for her to go after the asshole kid that outed her son like this.
Law Abiding Jennifer Garner
So The Punisher, but with racist undertones.
Yay.
My favourite star is back with a bang in a stylish Avatar.
s*o*.... 

female *r/ThePunisher* **?**


Sign. me. up.
Never have been a huge Jennifer Garner fan, pretty much never liked her in anything in the past.

That said, I hope this is a good movie and does well.

She is a good actress and should get back into movies instead of just commercials.

Plus, Ben screwed her over pretty bad.
This looks like what the Death Wish remake should have been.
Love to see Garner kicking ass again!
Peppermint is getting her life hunty 
Will Jamie Foxx mess up the ending of this one?
This looks really bad.
Gritty Charlie Brown spinoff.
inb4 we get a Peppermint/Sicario crossover
Was this a parody? 

It has every cliche I can imagine (and I can imagine a whole lot).

I love me some Revenge Movies, but you should try to not go out with a movie that would've been stale in 1980.
Did she say "peppermint in her butt?"

This movie looks awful. 
You know what... I'm watching this in theatres!
Pretty much Batman Begins but without the Batman. 
That's a lot of miles 
Oh nice trailer! Now i dont have to see the movie at all. I think the trailers showing us too much of the best parts. The trailers should be more of the teaser trailers, maybe +10 or 20 seconds longer. Not one minute long. 
Looks great.
Rated R?
Just want to point out that the movie is named after what the main character says is in her daughter's butt
Looks pretty good actually, I know my gf will be excited to see this.
Oh hell yes, I am *super* down for this movie.
Not watching this because puts Mexicans In a bad light. Probably only racists or Mexican haters are going to watch this. 
Go see me in this movie!!!![Sean Rosales attends peppermint world premiere ](http://m.zimbio.com/photos/Sean+Rosales/Premiere+STX+Entertainment+Peppermint+Red/Oms3neVoVsY) 
Haven't I seen this movie before?  Totally 100% percent innocent  white person gets traumatized and fights off the rampaging brown hordes?  So we're supposed to go along with Susie homemaker becoming a efficient killing machine (at ninja school I suppose) because that's how movies work  but anything other than a Mexican drug cartel is crazy talk?

At least Helena (Orphan Black) had trained from childhood to be a killing machine.  And they had the imagination to use  Eastern European bad guys.  But I guess that takes imagination and this didn't.
Wow that was hot garbage
I hope it is good.  I love those kind of premises!
How you hide a Batman film with a name like Peppermint. That carousel shot was ridiculously dope though
female death wish
So a white lady getting her gun is gonna be our savior from the evil ms-13 tattooed gangsters after brown people murder her family?

Hollywood keeps dusting off the same script and expecting a different result.

This reminds me of The Brave One (2007 film) starring Jodie Foster. [She was brutally beaten up and her boyfriend was murdered and her dog was kidnapped by some low level thugs and she finds a way to get a gun and becomes a vigilante going around New York City doing her own brand of justice and getting her dog back from the guys that attacked her in the process.](#spoiler)
I feel like they chose the wrong female lead for this movie. She just screams soccer mom and it seems more like a parody than an actual movie.

And she just shoots people, it's kinda boring. Like 5 years of "training" does not mean you can take down a cartel corrupt enough to buy cops and judges lmao this movie looks so fucking bad.
So is a throwaway line about her going into some off screen training going to keep this sub from calling Jennifer Garner a Mary Sue?
I love these types of revenge movies - Death Sentence, Death Wish etc.. but why Jennifer Garner? I don't buy her at all in the trailer.


my god i am so sick of "you killed this or took this im coming after fucking going into the hyperbolic time room motherfucker "
This movie looks like flat out garbage. I don't buy Jennifer Garner in this type of role at all. It just looks like one cliche after another.
"What's she been doing for the last 5 years?"

"Training...also...growing her hair out."
Within the first 10 seconds I assumed it was going to be a "loving parents lose their only child to a terminal illness and have to learn to cope with life and love again" kind of movie. *Definitely* pleasantly surprised, and actually excited for this movie. I'm a sucker for a good revenge flick.
Same. I'd actually use my movie pass to go see this. Assuming it doesn't go bankrupt before it comes out haha. 
I don't like it when trailer shows half of the movie already, instead of just giving a feel of the film.  Also, it looks like a pretty cliche revenge flick. 
That's a pretty common trailer trope
More like Jennifer Garner's The Punisher. 
Honestly the “system is broken” social commentary had me rolling my eyes but I’m kinda sold on “Jennifer Garner kicks ass” alone.
This isn't a good trailer. It looks like a ridiculous story with a thousand cliches. 
I texted my friend the link with "Sydney Bristow, vigilante."

I haven't been down with Jen's dramas as of late (heard great things about Love, Simon though), but I will see the shit out of this.
The whole time all i thought was [Ima going to kick your ass.](https://youtu.be/hfUawSznQBM?t=2413)
That makes this “The Punish-her”
Daredevil's ex-wife is The Punisher?
It looks like a mix of Death Wish and Punisher.

Death Wish: Loving parent who lives a normal, peaceful life loses everything, gets screwed over by corrupt law officials, and then decides to take justice into her own hands despite not knowing the first thing about killing.

Punisher: Extensive combat training, an arsenal of weapons kept in a van, brutally killing criminals and leaving them for the police to find, and taking the fight to entire criminal organizations.

Whatever it is, I'm interested in watching it.
Or basically Death Wish, which came out this year with the same exact premise. 
The Mumisher
Beat for beat.
Well at least they are not copying  the title 
does the movie feel like a period piece at all

I remember reading a synopsis and found that the intense homophobia would have been outdated years ago not to mention today
Have you seen [*the brave one?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_PT4zvbhFw)
Ehh, more like a gender swapped Death Wish movie
Well, it seems she will go after the white judge and white dirty cops as well.
Umm...yup.
As we all know there are exactly zero non white tattooed gangsters. Fuck whitey. Amen.

What exactly were you going for with this comment?
I...what?
This reminds me of the Punisher. Marvel Comics character which debuted in 1974. 
Her 5 seasons of Alias was her 5 years of training.  And they had her bringing down more than cartels there so this should be a piece of cake.
[deleted]
She's done more action roles than anything else if you count every episode of Alias and Elektra.
Have you seen Alias?  She got her start in an action role and absolutely killed it (pun intended).  I'm happy that she's finally getting away from being the typical suburban mom in everything she's in.

I need to rewatch Alias...
She has a really nice scene with her son.
And your post is "The Pun-is-her".
Ever see The Brave One?
And 44 years ago
Except unlike Bruce Willis in the new *Death Wish*, Jennifer Garner doesn’t seem to be sleepwalking through the movie.
The Long Death Wish Goodnight
No, definitely not. It's more focused on what the son is going through as a teenager mentally, emotionally, etc. during the coming out process. I thought it was really well done.
I see that too, I guess the "training for 5 years" thing reminded me of BB. 
True, she's gotta take out the deep state while she's at it.  This movie stinks of propaganda worse than a war film in an election year.
[deleted]
Nah.
I haven't seen it. I just think this movie looks like it's full of cliches and won't add nothing new. Btw I do agree that's it's nice that she's getting away from suburban mom roles.

Brave One was so much better than the new Death Wish https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_PT4zvbhFw
True, although I feel like a lot of these types of movies start with the "bad ass who gave up their bad assery but something happens to make them go bad ass again" premise. I appreciate this sort of take.

They could have gone (some random IT guys brings up file on computer) "she's Sydney Bristow went missing for years is skilled in etc etc." 
The bad guys are a huge mix of people in this, white people included. See 2:11

Also, here's the logline:

> A woman lands in a coma after a gang of thugs guns down her husband and daughter. Years later, she embarks on a mission to punish everyone she holds responsible -- including shady lawyers and corrupt cops.

Can't say that's especially Trumpian.
