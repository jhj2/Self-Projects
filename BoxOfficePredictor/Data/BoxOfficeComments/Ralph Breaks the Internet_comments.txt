"Man, I fucking love Disney!" - Disney
"Wrecks the internet kinda sounds better doesnt it?"

WRAP IT UP FOLKS RALPH = /R/MOVIES
This Disney eating its own tail thing is getting intense.
Ready Player One: look at all these references!

Wreck\-it\-Ralph 2: hold my beer
Funny that they actually adress the weird title at the end 
[Now, look at it! Gaze upon my empire of joy!](https://i.imgur.com/902wwGm.jpg)
I for one am glad that aside from knowing that they're going on the internet, there is little to no mention of what the plot will be. 
I'm actually wondering if there will be a main villain in here. The plot is pretty vague for now
I really hope Mario finally shows up in this movie. Wasn't Nintendo planning on finally allowing Mario to show up in the sequel?
Man I want them to visit the Muppet Show area so bad :(
So Disney is clearly drunk on their own power.
This is so meta I can't stand it.
Disney: The Ad
Also making appearances in this film: C-3PO, R2-D2, Yoda, Iron Man and Gamora.
I'll be very surprised if there's an adult website referenced in the film. Imagine seeing the pornhub logo in the background
lmao cinderella threatening a kid with a smashed glass slipper 

thats some bar fight shit
All the franchises Disney owns in an animated 3D is so nice to look at
Oh my gosh. This movie has Daft Punk in it? 

^(And ^Star ^Wars ^and ^Marvel)
Hahaha Princess Aurora was sleeping when Venelope glitched inside the room.
That Princess gag is funny though, they have little bit of fun with strong man save the day cliche.
That scene with the Princesses was everything I hoped it would be and more. Can't wait
Well, that's it folks! Y'all can stop complaining about the stupid title now.
And here I thought Mulan & Pocahontas weren't gonna make the Disney Princesses cameo cut. ~~Where Anastasia at though?~~
Holy hell. Fucking Iron Man’s in this!!!
Disney is cranking the meta to 11 on this one. The scene with the princesses is brilliant.
I can only imagine how this movie would depict Reddit
Some stream of consciousness:

- I'm glad Disney is open to being self-referential, but I hope they don't do *too* crazy with it. It feels like that's kind of all they showed in this trailer, but I'm reasonably confident that it won't be the entire movie.

- I'm actually kind of interested in the idea of the movie not really having a tangible villain. However, the fact that we haven't seen one at all makes me equally worried that they're going to do the whole "surprise villain" thing *again*.

- If the new purple chick does literally anything controversial, reddit will decide she's SJW propaganda and will bend over backwards to hate her. I look forward to the polite and nuanced discussion this will invite.

- I'm not sure how I feel about the title joke. It could have been *way* worse than it was, but it may play out a bit differently in the final movie, and you have to be very careful with that kind of self-deprecating humor.

Overall I think I get a good feeling.
As a huge fan of the first one I was worried. Looks like they have done a great job though!

Would love Fix it Felix and Mario to interact.
I am here for Cinderella's shoe shiv.
I now have faith in this movie since they addressed the terrible title.

Also I'm pretty sure I'm just going to want an entire movie of the Disney Princesses sitting in a room airing their grievances about all the tropes involved with their movies.
I really like this style of trailer that shows a few short scenes instead of a mashup of gags and action shots. I was already on board for this movie but now I'm even more pumped.
"Oh my God" "Oh my Disney"

are they trying to say Disney is God? 
Nothing says 2018 like a Daft punk song from 2001.
Is this Kingdom Hearts 3? 
Will Iron Man speak in this film? Please let It be Robert Downey Jr if Iron Man ever speaks.
I liked it when they put Daft Punk's "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" in the trailer.
Final, we have now the Disney Cinematic Princess Universe. Thank you Wreck-It-Ralph. 
Bummer this trailer is mostly geared around Disney IPs rather than video games. Hopefully that's not the case with the actual movie. I look at this and it's charming but I'm not sure why this is a Wreck-It-Ralph movie. 
So... they know the title is shitty... but they're really committed to keeping it because of that Kim K thing. Ok.
Not that the first one really indulged on its video game premise / setting after the first 20 minutes or so, but it seems like this one will almost entirely be abandoning that concept.  I'm sure it will be good, I just still hope there's room for Mario and friends.
So close to a kingdom hearts movie I can almost taste it.
I RECOGNIZED SOME THINGS SO I CLAPPED
Holy fuck that's a long ass Disneyworld advert.
Holy shit, that princess gag had me in stitches.

Self-Aware Disney=Best Dsiney
That really is a bit too "hail corporate" for me.
"Do people assume all your problems got solved because a big strong man showed up"  
I might give that line a pass if a different Princess had said that, but Rapunzel?  Girl was straight up an emotionally\-abused prisoner of Mother Gothel, wouldn't have even left her tower if Eugene hadn't shown up, and she would have wound up a slave for the rest of her life if Eugene hadn't cut her hair.  The center of Tangled is fluff adventure stuff, her character's main problems both required the intervention of Eugene.  


That line is a bit too tongue\-in\-cheek and I feel a slap in the face of fans of the Disney Princes.  
\- Prince Eric was hypnotized by magic, but as soon as the spell wears off he fight Eels and steers the wreckage of a sunken ship into Ursula to save Ariel.  
\- Prince Phillip goes full savage mode to escape Maleficent's castle before taking down the Mistress of all Evil \(because the faeries could not do it on their own\)  
\- Cinderella would have been stuck in her tower unless she got a little help from Bruno \(okay, there's no defending Prince Charming, sorry\)  
\- Prince Adam saved Belle from wolves, not a central "problem" but I'll count cases of saving a life.  
\- Aladdin puts in all the work in his own movie.  All Princess Jasmine does is show she knows how to pole vault and distract a villain with a kiss.  
\- Snow White's Prince... "Florian"?  Yeah he doesn't do much in Snow White.  But the Dwarves sure do.  


Even in Wreck It Ralph.  Ralph saves Vanellope and then she saves him right back, but you don't "dismiss" the other characters with such a flippant line like that.  It's too "wink wink" "girl power yeah" and it got on my nerves because stories need all the characters working together with all of their strengths and faults \- that's what makes them classics \(well, they're also classics because they are old and have all been rewritten from their source materials in ways which always water down product in a way that makes them palpable for what modern entertainment types think is palpable for children audiences, but that's another rant\).
I don't know about the rest of you but this trailer made me cringe the fuck out.

The references to big internet names like Snapchat and Twitter, and the parodies of internet related tools like the search engine parody are fine and I can handle. But that huge Disney plug seems REALLY shoehorned in, a la Emoji Movie Just Dance app. Also, I can't remember the last time I heard someone refer to "breaking the internet" in that sort of meme-esque style. Gives me some "teh penguin of d00m" vibes. At least in my lexicon, "breaking the internet" is definitely no longer a "thing".

EDIT: Elaborated.
This is genuinely so exciting. Yeah, the app product placement is kinda gross and Disney are definitely sucking their own dick with this movie, but as long as it has substance and meaning then what’s the problem? Disney don’t often let me down.

Plus, Cinderella was fully about to cut a bitch. She used her glass slipper as a goddamn shank. Fuck your cynicism.
Disney: why make movies anymore when we can just spend 90 minutes referencing every single one of our properties? People will eat that shit up. 
I think a lot of people are probably overestimating the amount of “advertising” that the actual movie is going to feature. They’re putting most of their “hey I know that character” eggs in their trailer basket because they’re trying to “break the internet”, as the title of the film implies. That’s why we got so much of the Disney princesses bit, Twitter is predictably going wild about it and more people are talking about it than they would if it focused more on just the characters. Trailers are supposed to hook people. I have faith that the real film isn’t going to be what the trailer suggests. 
I'm actually super pumped about this movie. Disney seems pretty self\-aware and willing to poke fun at itself. 
The princess scene is really cute, but I can't help but wish that it was like a 5 minute short on the DVD or something instead of being in the actual movie. I really love the first movie and as much as I like the idea of a "ready player one, disney edition", I can't help but think that this is the wrong movie for that. 
I'm gonna get downvoted to hell for this, but I really don't see why this is any different from the Emoji Movie in terms of promoting brands to children. Both are animated films appealing to kids, and both seem to have a clear corporate agenda - how is taking characters to Dropbox any different than taking characters to Oh My Disney? While this movie will most likely be better written than the Emoji Movie ever was, there's still no denying that this film is centered around product placement and promoting such products to kids through the veil of a popular animated film. That really does not sit right with me.
This is straight up a Disney ad. Hardly even feels like a movie. 
For all the shit you guys gave the emoji movie im surprised how well reddit is receiving this movie. This looks awful.
After watching this a few times, I have a theory. My first reaction to this trailer was honestly severe disappointment. Although the first half was great, and just what i expected, the second half was blatant "look how awesome Disney is". But on my 3rd re\-watch I noticed something interesting. When the search bar tells her about Disney, it almost looks like he glitches or breaks. To be fair, this could just be visual flair, or Disney saying Disney is so cool that he is overwhelmed, but I think it's a sign of something different. Here's the theory.

The story is going to be about the Disney site being corrupted/broken by someone, and it's going to be a meta take on the corporate side of Disney. I wouldn't be surprised if the "villain" is literally product placement.

Thoughts?
That princess scene was a little cringe
Disney is full on trolling and I’m all for it. 

This is the Enchanted for this decade, where Disney pats itself on the back on its plethora of IPs and its history, and we eat it up. 
A little weird to see the Gran Turismo logo, I don't really associate it with "the internet", but cool I guess.
Daft Punk worked for Tron Legacy -Disney Exec
"Take me to a website that's super intense and really nuts!"

This'll be a meme within 24 hours, I'm calling it.
Regarding the joke about the name of the movie in the trailer

I feel like this is the version of those sweatshop notes you hear about in the news every so often. You know the ones where the “worker” hides a note begging for help in the pocket of a shirt he’s sewn, and someone in an Oklahoma Walmart finds it.  

This is the only way the writers can speak to the outside world about all the dumb ass corporate decisions going on
I've never watched a company masturbate before.
I used to love Disney, 

I used to love Disney

I even had the mouse ears, 

I thought I was Disney
To be fair, there’s a LOT of material at their fingertips without having to go outside their brand. Princesses, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars...
I watch almost all movies that Disney releases, but this trailer felt waaaaay too self-congratulatory for me. 
I was just looking at the poster thread from yesterday, everyone complaining about the title and the Disney team is like "inb4..."
Reddit is so going to be in this movie...
They're lampshading their own movie title!!!
He really broke the internet.

Anyone else feel like this is judt a big advert for disney?
Wreck-it-Ralph seems more to be "look at all these brand placement". 

Oh and also, we'll show to people that don't follow movie news that we own everything now.
Ready Player One: how many times can we shoehorn Tracer from Overwatch I to this movie? 

“LETS FIND OUT!”
I don't think any movie will ever come close to the amount of refrences shown/used in RPO. Its worth mentioning that the author of RPO is working on a follow up book aptly named Ready Player Two.
lol, its like they are talking directly to /r/movies
It's the movie equivalent of that guy who lights up a cigarette and says, "Yeah, I know smoking is bad. I really should quit."
It's damage control. 
I just really love that they have the Muppets up on the same level as those other huge franchises. 
I wonder if Mickey might show up? Besides that image.
Hey an ERB reference! I miss those videos.
Look on my works, ye mighty and despair!
Disney even owns ERB its insane
Disney Animation made Wreck-it Ralph and also this movie. So it hurts my head a little that Wreck-it Ralph can go there on the internet. It's a bit like Obi-Wan in Attack of the Clones walking past Lucasfilm, or a cinema that's showing Trainspotting. 
It really feels weird they're showing off like that.  All these huge franchises.  Nice to see Eve, the Up house, and Nani though.
[Reference for those who have never seen it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXBJIZ1NXFU)
Ralph goes to the internet.  He breaks the internet.  [Then he has to fix the internet by overcoming some personal problems.](#spoiler)
Yea, it's actually kind of refreshing to have this more "teaser\-style" trailer that doesn't ruin what happens like so many others. I am actually hesitant now to watch any movie trailer because so many of them give away major plot points. 
I just hope it isnt some big Ralph saves the whole internet type deal and is used as a setting to tell a better story
Plot twist: There is no plot. Only an extended array of puns

That purple character at the end. I'm sure.
I hope the villains are the Disney Princesses or at least one of them.

Calling it right now: Taraji P. Henson's character is the big bad. Doesn't her facial expressions seem a little... *sinister* to any of you?

In any case, **you heard it here first!**
If I remember correctly they did say the voice actor of Mario was gonna do it.
It's not that he wasn't allowed, but apparently Disney couldn't really think of anywhere to put him and didn't want to waste him. I recall there being an interview that they thought of something good and that he's for certain showing up in this one.
I wonder if the Mario movie being made by Universal changed that.
I want them to visit the Pixar area just as badly!

I just want to see what Wall-E's been up to!
the giant beaker head in the background was perfect when Vanellope is running from the stormtroopers
i think it's in there cause they recently rebooted 'the muppet babies' and it's awesome, well according to my kids
In your conception of this, do you want digital puppets with digital hands up them, or digital characters sans digital hands?
Thínk you'll like the end of this [Rap Battle](https://youtu.be/PXBJIZ1NXFU)!

When Vanellope requested a crazy website from the search bar, I half wanted it to suggest 4chan.

I love Cinderella breaking the glass slipper to make a shiv.
But a big strong man did save Vanellope and solved her problems?
Peterson is going to love this movie.
Pocahontas'  hair blowing in the wind was hilarious.
Cinderella smashing her glass slipper into a shiv is pretty much the best thing. 
Anyone know if they got the original voice actors for the newer princesses like Rapenzul, Anna, and Elsa?
I love how they even changed some of their designs for fit the style of the movie. Like Rapunzel and Merida kinda have different facial structures from their original movies.
Meg never gets a look in during these events. 
Them going meta and naming all the identical tropes and plot drama the princesses go through. "Are you guys okay, should I call the police?"
I had no expectations.  It was great.
Is Pocahontas holding the club that Chief Powhattan was going to use to execute John Smith?
Can you imagine if they all do a group music number?
Anyone else notice Merida being done with everyones shit the entire trailer?

"Disney brats. I wanna go back to Pixar"
I don't know if it was supposed to be funny but I died on the "kidnapped and enslaved" line. 
Since I've seen that sequence, I don't need to see the rest of the movie. 
They admit it’s a dumb name. They just don’t care. 
She belongs to Fox Animation, I think?  Don Bluth movie, not Disney.
> ~~Where Anastasia at though?~~

Now *that* could be a great joke. Ideally it would just be a background gag though, not something they really draw attention to.
Where's maid marian?
Where’s Princess Leia ?!
> Where Anastasia at though?

We'll have to wait for the 21st Century Fox deal to go through.
Now Kida needs to break in somehow. She meets the requirements!
Don't forget the Storm Troopers.
If he speaks and it’s not RDJ I want no higher than 10% on RT.

^^^/s ^^^obviously
So did Disney buy all those franchises so they could make this movie?
Those are all of the original voice actors who are still alive, too.
"You see that shadowy place over there? We don't go there."
I'd like to think of it as a pile of passive aggressive sticky notes on every other site.
> I'm glad Disney is open to being self-referential, but I hope they don't do too crazy with it.

The scene in this trailer isn't the first time Disney has had this sort of thing. Remember when Zazu sings *It's a Small World* and Scar desperately tells him to stop? 
What are you getting at with  the point about a surprise villain? Feel like I’ve seen this criticism of recent Disney movies a lot lately, and it seems like it’s just the other basic type of villain (as opposed to one who is advertised as the villain). Like...what’s the problem if it’s either/or? Is there a different approach that would be better?

Seems like it also flattens out the villains as they actually are in these movies. For example I don’t think it’s even the case that the first Wreck-It Ralph has a surprise villain. It was clear from the start that King Candy was *a* villain, the reveal that he’s Turbo just fleshed out his intentions and it even fit his type of video game character (he just went to another racing game).
On your first point, based on the first film all the internet stuff and in turn the meta Disney stuff is mostly set dressing to focus on the original characters so I can see them doing that again here.
Wasn't their a Disney princess movie already that is self-referentail with Amy Adam? 
Haha so true about the purple girl. There sure are a lot of sensitive snowflakes on here. 
Fix it Felix: Aren't you a plumber?

Mario:Ya, but all I've done is save a princess multiple times .....for 15+ yrs
I reckon the conversation about the title was probably one that they had with the marketing people and were like "fuck it, if we have to do this shit we're putting this in the movie!"
**Music Intensifies**  
“Ralph no!!”  
“This is it! We have to finish this!”  
**Big epic action set piece**  
**Cue BADASS title**  
**funny joke at the end**

That’s one of their online services
They probably got some voice overs for sure. Apparently gamora is in it too.
Dibs on Venellope being the Tony Stark of the group
The Kim K. thing definitely made the phrase more well known. But breaking the internet has been a term that's been around longer than that. 
My theory that they are going online to create their own mobile game and that's where the naming scene at the end comes from.
They’ve really been cranking it up in their recent animation.
Honestly, if Mulan had said that line, I probably would've gotten a huge laugh out of it. But otherwise, I agree with you, it got on my nerves a lot and made me say out loud "Umm, did a lot of you forget your own stories?"

I get it, girl power and stuff, but still. That line just did not jive with me.
Mulan is Disney’s strongest female character so she should have said it
I agree. Just imagine how badly this movie is going to age.
I was really hoping there would be more of us. This is exactly the same as emoji movie except people are already so emotionally invested in the Disney brand that they don't feel like they're being sold to.

What's really disappointing is that the target audience is absolutely children, and this is a naked attempt to imprint these brands on their susceptible minds.
[deleted]
Personally the product placement feels worse in this than in the emoji movie. In the emoji movie I can kinda deal with the product placement because I know that they got money for it, but this was just Disney jerking themselves off
[deleted]
I wonder if they'll acknowledge Wreck-It Ralph as a movie franchise too, like how Woody finds out in Toy Story 2.
Never watched a Microsoft, Apple, Google, Or Amazon keynote presentation?
Disney lurks in /r/movies confirmed.
It’ll just be some nerds complaining about Star Wars for 15 minutes.
I'm just picturing a slow pan to reddit/4chan as the shadowlands with Mufasa/Simba style dialogue of "You must never go there".
/r/MemeEconomy
So they bought Star Wars and Marvel for 8 billion dollars, not because they wanted to make the MCU or make a new triquel but because they had plans to include it in a movie where ALL their animated movies come together. Have we seen Baymax in Wreck it Ralph yet?

Man if they can do this for Wreck it Ralph, just think about the potential KH3 has now. This makes me hyped for both the movie and whatever E3 reveal. 
WHAT?

*goes back to watch again*

Fuck. I wish I was a kid now. Disney's putting my childhood to shame. 
very cool

Yep, you tell them, Ralph.
AAAAHAHAAAAAAA.... LOOK AT HOW MUCH STUFF WE OWN!!!  UUUUUNLIIIMIITEEED POWWWAAAAAAA!
When you think about it, any product they produce is really an advertisement for themselves, since they make all their money from said brands, even the new ones they create.
Vertical Integration: The Movie!
Ready Player One was a mostly forgettable book, so crammed with references it sometimes seemed to forget it had a plot. I was hate-reading by the end, just because my friends wouldn't shut up about it.
If Disney is paying attention to Reddit, I'm wildly interested in what they're thinking of the revolt in r/prequelmemes right now. 
Seriously, reading some of those comments after seeing them address it this trailer is hilarious.
less /r/movies and, you know, the internet.

Shows the movie might actually know enough of its stuff to be more than just pandering. Theres a fine line between pandering and commentary with a premise like this, lets see how it goes.
makes me think they will have a whole scene
PLEASE

Muppets have been kinda dead for a while, I need more Muppets content T_T
It's really interesting given that, all things considered, the Muppets are like Disney's red-headed stepchildren.
Maybe. You can see it in top of the "Disney Animation" hat
I think Mickey showing up is highly likely
You DONT FUCKING TALK TO ME like that *huhhuh*
https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-3o7TKRepXl8PrZo568 My expectations are pretty high here
You're not alone, my friend =(
Epic Rap Battles?
What happened to them?  They stopped making videos...
Where?
Yup, they reference that in the battle. Disney says “I’m owning this battle! In fact, I own this whole series!”
Fuck dude they even had a Brother Bear reference in that shot. I was under the impression even Disney forgot about that movie.
Wow I feel like I've already seen the movie with that sleuth work.
Ralph has to stop a computer virus who happens to be voiced by Alan tudyk. 
pretty sure he just unplugs the router and plugs it back in
The marketing for Disney's animated films has been great over the last few years. They very rarely give too much away about the plot. 
> to tell a better story

I admire your optimism.
Net Neutrality is the villain. And so Ralph has to break the Internet. 
i love you
Thanos of course
Leia wants revenge for not being in the Princess Club. 
I hope not. It'd kinda soil their image. 
Have it be Elionwy from The Black Cauldron. She wants revenge because she was never accepted into the Disney Princess Club because The Black Cauldron bombed.
Wait, are you telling me that the nice character that introduces the protagonist to a new world is actually going to be revealed as the villain at the end of the second act? Disney would *never* do that with any of their properties!
So, Paarthurnax from Skyrim confirmed?!?!

Awesome!
You remembered rightly.
> voice actor of Mario

Charles Martinet!
I have to think it will be a meta gag about the similarity between Felix and Mario.
You know. Knowing Disney movies and cameos. I would expect Mario to appear right before the climax where he acts as the mediator or random friend to either of the two. 

Here's my take: The 2 separates and one of them gets losts into a Mario game because of them fighting with each other. Mario finds them and asks what's wrong. He gives his 1-2 on the situation in a heartwarming and inspiring talk, giving the character the inspiration be able to move on and save the plot etc. 
I sincerely doubt it.

For one thing, it's clearly not going to be a case of Nintendo licensing out Mario for a big role in WIR2, hence the Unversal movie.

Secondly, It's basically just an additional precence for Mario for Universal's own product (not that *Mario* needs it or anything.)

Thirdly...nothing a check can't fix.
Woah it spells out Is Meta 
[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/917/)
Surprised they didn't show Jimmy Neutron in the princess room.
The villain is actually Ice-Knack
I’ll do you one better: *who* is Gamora?

> Nuts

This search engine is garbage if that doesn't bring up some porn.
I can see that being the "realistically everybody in Ready Player One would have just been endlessly killing and torturing each other" of this movie.
and then Internet historian will have to make a vid about this film 
The search bar found all the crazy fucked up porn sites but safe search was on.
I imagine it'll make a parental guardian safe search joke.
You joke but Pornhub did become Cornhub for like a week. Its front page was full of videos of corn. 
Some good old cornography. 
That was supposed to be Stub Hub, not Porn Hub.
Probably made the budget back on product placement alone.
Kinda feels like they have already tbh
*Yeah,* since the first few seconds are just money shots of huge corporate logos, I'm gonna say they already have.
Good GOD I want to play as Cinderella with a glass slipper shiv so badly now 
Low-key, I'd play the fuck out of a Disney fighting game.
Yeah, Tron Legacy is my second favorite feature-length concept album music video by Daft Punk.
Oh yes. Still listen to the soundtrack sometimes. 
I lost it when she smashed her shoe to use as a weapon

level 2 Chancla right there
She went from 0 to 100 real quick, I was not ready 
Holy shit, just realised that she has her pinky finger out while holding the slipper. I want to meet the animator who made that decision and firmly shake his/her hand.
And Jasmine in the background using the Genie's lamp as a gun.
Like with most of their stories...
I'm more confused about Rapunzel's sudden beef with Eugene... What the hell, blondie?
Mulan would like a word with you.
That's why she says yes. 
Man, that guy sucks.

**Edit:** Uh, thanks for the gold, I guess?
Whose dat
Pocahontas didn't really look Native American 
Colours of the wind keeping her hair on point lol
It was? God damn that scene is full of small details i missed. 
Disney likes to keep a wholesome image, but every now and then they have to throw in a shiv or poison apple to remind people that if you turn your back on the Mouse, he will make you regret it. 
Is Cindy gonna have to cut a bitch?
And it makes sense, because she was low born and survived everything life threw at her. She never expected anyone to rescue her and thus would defend herself as a matter of course.
I think everyone has their original voice except for really old ones like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Hell even the original Belle voice is back. 
That was definitely Mandy Moore voicing Rapunzel!
According to wikipedia, only Snow White, Cinderella and Aurora have new voice actresses.
Looks like they did:
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5848272/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast

 * Rapenzel - Mandy Moore

 * Elsa - Idina Menzel

 * Anna - Kristen Bell

 * Jasmine - Linda Larkin

 * Mulan - Ming-Na Wen

 * Belle - Paige O'Hara

 * Ariel - Jodi Benson

 * Moana - Auli'i Cravalho

and more.


Rapunzel's kinda bugs me for some reason. All the others look fine.

Edit: Looking at it more, I think it's the fact that her skin is too pale here. Plus she's missing her little overbite.
I'm kind of curious how she'd look in this style. She's my favorite even if not an official Disney princess.
From what I’ve heard there’s going to be a joke about her being “from the other studio” so it wouldn’t surprise me if she’s fed up with their shit.
"Disney:  Fuck you nerds, we're gonna make billions off of this franchise."
I wonder if it's a jab at marketing -- the whole conversation there sounds exactly like a conversation that could have happened between the filmmakers and the marketing division.
She is. As soon as disney gets fox though...

No no, no need for sarcasm.  You're absolutely right.

I would accept Adrian Pasdar, but that's not *ideal*.
The wickedly talented Adele Dazeem? 
Mary Costa (OG Aurora) is still alive, but she’s long since retired.
Wouldn't that be 4Chan? 
they could literally put Mufasa in the movie to make this exact joke
"once you go in, there's no way you can get out"
Yeah, I'm totally fine with that kind of thing. It's not like a significant chunk of The Lion King was just about Disney referencing itself.
Enchanted, but it was more about goofing on the princess tropes, not any princesses in particular. I did like the line from the movie about having plenty of time to get to know each other after the wedding.

Dear god if I could go a day without someone using this petty insult 
You’re technically not wrong on the “15+ years”, but he’s been around for 35+ years...
"Yes-a, but other duty calls, hehe"
I'm sure that conversation included "those r/movie assholes love M E T A bullshit" too lol
So that's where she went.
I have it on good authority that if you type "Google" *into* Google, you will in fact break the internet.
Yeah.  Mulan, Pocahontas, Merida, Tiana, or the Frozen Princesses.  Any of them would be better to deliver that line.
It'll be a period piece for future generations.
Just wait for redlettermedia to say a single negative thing about it and watch the general tone change.
Cool, they'll hopefully make my Mr. Litwak/ Andy's mom fanfiction canon next.

Also, I think Vanellope has my least favourite voice in any animated film ever. 
So an apt portrayal, you say?
They are probably on reddit when discussing the name of the movie. 
If they include a force ghost luke skywalker I'm sure it would be salt in the wound.
I really hope u/gallowboob appears as a gallow and a boob and just repeats back what everyone else says.

Horizontal.
No, that's comcast. Disney is more horizontal. 
The plot was more of a segway into the various refrences. Overall the book is largely a nostalgia trip for those who grew up in the late 70's, 80's 90's and some refrences from the 00's. I always tell people if you're going into RPO expecting a crazy good story just set your expectations aside and enjoy the trip down memory lane.
Got it, they want a Leia origin story.
"They like Ewan McGregor eh?"

"I've got it! An entire trilogy of Christopher Robin films! That's what the fans want!"
What if it’s actually just Disney employees pushing for an Obi Wan movie to create hype? 
At this point I wouldn't ever do an Obi Wan story out if pure spite.

Or maybe cast Brendan Fraser as the new Obi Wan just to see what happens.
I haven't been paying attention there, what's going on?
If Disney paid *any* attention to reddit, people in multiple subs were being pretty vocal and clear about their less than favorable opinion on Solo. Opinions that they chose to ignore.

Is this for real? Cause Paarthurnax is fucking awesome, probably the best character in Skyrim.

Edit: Saw the other replies, very cool.
If they did it right, they'd have this shot where mario's feet land in frame in the foreground. Ralph excitedly points and says, "Well I'll be, it's Mario!" Then cut to reverse shot on Luigi with a defeated look. Ralphs goes, "Why are you green now, Mario?"

And that's ALL WE GET. 
And maybe setting up a running gag with the 'big, strong man' thing and bringing in Peach too
Felix game is like the original jump man but Ralph himself is more a mix of Bowser and DK. 
But all he does is say "It's a me, Mario", "Ooh", "Ahh", "Waaaaaah", and "Wha wha whahooooo".

They’ve recently, starting with Frozen’s “you can’t marry someone you just met” as far as I can tell, been mocking themselves a lot in their animation.

Zootopia has all the bootlegs of their movies, and Moana makes fun of the “princess” formula.
Just ask the Jonas Brothers what happens when you talk back to the Mouse.
Why does Snow White keep a poisoned apple on her? 
Cinderella in Cinderella 3 is pretty damn awesome. 
Paige O’Hara (the voice of Belle) and Jodi Benson (voice of Ariel) are in their 50s and 60s and are still involved with Disney projects. Paige paints for the Disney Store, and Jodi recites the nativity story at Epcot or Disneyland every holiday season. 
[deleted]
Mandy's been doing Rapunzel's voice on the TV show as well.
Pretty sure that’s because those three voice actors aren’t alive anymore.
I think Cinderella has been Jennifer Hale for years now. So while not the "original" VA, it won't be someone new to the character.
Ming-Na's back ayyy
Her overbite is what made her seem more realistic.

That said, I think they're going off the animated series design redone back into 3d...
"AND you're all going to love this movie and pay for all our merchandising anyway because we own the childhood of your grandparents, your parents, you, and every single generation after you."
Still doesn't make her a Disney Princess.  If that was the case, Leia and Padme should be in there.  And Shuri, and Karolina Dean, and dozens of other Marvel princesses that I'm not remembering off the top of my head.
AND AT-ST's AT-ST'S!

My dad can’t stop calling her that as a joke and I love it.

Am I wrong, or was Vanellope's voice softer and more kid-like in the first movie? In the trailer the voice is scratchy and older-sounding, closer to Sarah Silverman's normal voice.

It's ironic.
This is Disney straight up flexing in front of all the other major studios. It’s not even subtle lmfao. 
Well, they are hardly gonna have Ralph visit the Paramount web site, are they?
No a Luke Skywalker origin story. A three hour epic drama about the daily life of a Tatooine moisture farmer.
Holdo/Leia buddy film, gotcha.
You joke but if they make a kid Leia movie and get Millie Bobby Brown to play her I'd be first in line to watch.
That would also be good. Just put Ewan in every movie, he makes everything better.
Mods just said don't post Ewan Mcgregor stuff unless it actually pertains to him playing Obi-wan or the Prequels. Lots of people took it waaaaay out of context (and is basically a meme itself at this point) and Ewan memes flooded everything.

Yeah, Disney's interest in videogames, sans Kingdom Hearts, seemed to have died along with the toys-to-live craze and Disney Infinity soon followed suit.

And even at that they do not seem to care about KH, with Square taking care of the franchise 100% by themselves. 
Yes, because Disney is famous for placing morality above financial success when making business decisions.
Imagine the #NotMyLeia hashtags. Star Wars is srsbsns.

Yea, I just pointing out how weird that line was coming from them. That's literally what their stories are about, it's weird they are playing it off like the audience is making assumptions

Not recent. Goes back to at least Enchanted in the mid-late '00s.
Don't forget Zootopia also had that speech by Chief Bogo to Judy Hops: "Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and all your insipid dreams magically come true! So Let... It... Go."
I mean, it's a good thing that they're acknowledging the shortcomings of their past movies in a wholesome way. Like the disclaimers they put on the reruns of their rather more racist old cartoons.
Poor Nick, barely made it out alive. He weeps for his lost brothers of Jonas. 
As a warning to others.
Same reason Aurora has a cursed spinning wheel in their dressing room.
Paige and Jodi have been heavily involved with both Belle and Ariel for years. They voice the characters in nearly if not all all of their appearances \(Kingdom Hearts included\). They also cameoed in Enchanted. Paige O'Hara also gave Emma Watson advice and singing lessons to help her portray Belle \(Jodi will probably do the same for whoever plays Ariel in the Little Mermaid remake\). 
I’m Cinderella and this is my favorite store in the Magic Kingdom. 
Mary Costa (Aurora) is still alive but is 88 and retired. 
I'm positive if they really wanted the original voice actors, Disney would have some way to get them back.

Her character sounds like an 8 year old who has been smoking for 50 years. 
You're not wrong. Though, depending on how long after the first one this movie takes place, having her sound older may not be wrong.
Well Sarah is pushing 50, maybe she can't do the little girl voice perfectly anymore. It's been 6 since the first was released, but she probably did the voiceover sometime in 2011.

7 years of weed vaping probably hurts her ability to do voices at that age.

Or, OR, make it a documentary about moisture farming. Have it follow a full season of farming from seeding(?) to harvest. Interviews with Baru, Owen, Luke, maybe a droid or two. Follow Luke into Toshi station to get some power converters. Maybe show how they get blue milk by trading with the farm next door.

I really want to see this now..

"God fucking damnit..."
Fun fact, instead of going to ohmydisney.com they were originally planned to go to disneyinfinity.com, but the game got canned!

Carpet is in the scene. Jasmine is floating on him as Vanellope enters the room.
Kinda weird that Merida would agree with that bit since the only help she got was from her brothers, which was basically her pointing them in a direction and saying "*go be yourselves, but in bear form*"
I don't think that's a fair assessment of the line. Yes, some Disney princesses like Aurora and Snow White were saved by the princes and were literally waiting/sleeping to be saved.

But Cinderella was not saved by the prince. Her animal friends helped her. Tiana was the one responsible for sending Facilier to hell. Rapunzel is a pretty neat case where it's obvious she and Eugene are partner (similar to Tiana and Naveen). Pocahontas saved John Smith from an actual execution.

Yeah, Shang saved Mulan that one time, but it was plot relevant and she later ended up saving all of China (before that she killed hundreds of Huns so). Ariel saved Eric, moving the plot along, and Eric returned the favor by killing Ursula.

Merida, Elsa, Anna, and Moana are pretty modern and don't have the same trope applied to them.

Belle is arguable. Beast saved her from the wolves, she tended to him, but she came back to help towards the end of the story. So yeah, Disney has the reputation of damsel in distress, but when you look at it, it isn't as black and white as it appears except for specific cases like Snow White and Aurora. In the latter, Phillip was the fairies' literal tool; he wouldn't have survived if not for them.
Girl Power Bux. Half of the princesses would have been in *very* bad spots had a filthy man not shown up.
I like they're making Disney princesses cool characters on their own, but I was low-key hoping to see Aurora with an obvious fake smile, or something similar, as...well...she really did nothing and would be pretty much f&cked if Phillip hadn't saved her.

I like the joke, but I would really love it if they do address it in the final film. Disney has a long story of damsels in distress.
She had Maui. 
On a side\-note, I'm really looking forward to the sequel cleverly named "Dis\-Enchanted". I'm also a man approaching middle age.
Jodi is also Barbie in Toy Story, she hasn't lost her youthful voice yet.
> Paige O'Hara also gave Emma Watson advice and singing lessons

**We’ll end this here before someone actually takes this seriously and this whole page goes to shit.**



Edit: I put this part in bold because I’m telling you the truth. Please nobody respond to these posts.
Omg yes! I swear no one else played this game
I wonder who'd they'd use as a villain for KH. I don't think Thanos would be an appropriate Kingdom Hearts villain for the Marvel world - a secret boss sure (with the Infinity Gauntlet too), but his goals don't have room for Heartless and he wouldn't team up with Xehanort or Organization 13. 

Ebony Maw on the other hand, would be perfect, as would Ultron and Hela. Kaecilius could be an interesting one, and we could even get a new Time spell that allows us to reverse time by a certain amount. Loki could easily reprise his role as a redeemable antagonist, like Riku and Axel, and be a recurring character throughout the game.
That's what happens when you own some of the premiere boys and girls franchises in the world and have one of the biggest amusement parks in the world. 
I was going to make a Reddit comment, but it is too much:

THERE'S THREE SUNS AND NO WOMEN, WHAT ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
Whoa it spells out Wisow.

I think we are getting too deep here.
Merida is probably hyper-aware of the trope, though, and is also from a different studio.  Arguably, she got into the "princess club" based on literally being a princess by birthright.
Moana escaped the tunnel that Maui left her in, recovered the Heart of Te Fiti from the Kakamora, orchestrated the escape from Tamatoa, and ultimately realized what had to be done to return the Heart of Te Fiti. Maui just kind of had to guide Moana, teach her how to sail, and distract Te Ka at the end.
It's true, when she sang at the D23 Expo in 2011 (I know, 7 years ago, but she was still 50 at the time) she barely sounded a day older than when she recorded Ariel. She's very capable of manipulating her voice that way, much like Lea Salonga years after singing Jasmine and Mulan. Paige O'Hara's voice, however, unfortunately hasn't aged quite as well... but she was already 35 when BatB was released, so who can blame her?
She tried her best
LOL. I will never get over how dirty they did Belle in that movie. It's not like there's a shortage of young billable stars who can sing, lots of them have good stage-quality voices. The entire Disney Renaissance formula is based on the Broadway musical model, the least they can do is give us some good music when rebooting stuff that doesn't need to be rebooted...
Well that's just adorable.
WERE THERE ANY?
NOPE
VERY COOL.

I think it would be Loki. In the previous Kingdom hearts game each world is usually a loose retelling of the movie. I could see the Marvel world being the battle of New York.
