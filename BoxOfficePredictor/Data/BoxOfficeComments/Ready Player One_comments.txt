I cannot aptly express how good Ben Mendelsohn is as a villian in EVERYTHING he's in.
Waiting for r/MovieDetails to point out all the Easter eggs in this trailer.
Seeing the Iron Giant again brings a smile to my face. Hopefully we'll see him go all-out attack mode at some point
I'm surprised the RX-78-2 gets this much screentime. It got like, 2 shots for itself. Is it a big part of the book or something?


At 2.05, Tracer from Overwatch?
Holliday's message felt kind of flat
I cannot imagine who do you have to talk to to have all the cameos from Street Fighter through Deadpool till Tracer
If I saw the episode of Community based on this, do I already know the plot?
THE RX-78-2 FROM OG GUNDAM FUCKING WHAT
Willy Wonka & the Oasis.
Hell yeah, Kaneda’s bike from Akira!
ITS A GIANT FUCKING METAPHOR FOR NET NEUTRALITY
Tracer confirmed
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS
I'm really looking forward to this. The book does rely FAR too heavily on reference drops but it's a good foundation to make a DAMN fun movie with Spielberg at the helm. Most of the references in Roger Rabbit were there because Spielberg sought them out and his clout was enough for studios to say yes.
If everyone in this world is obsessed with the 80s because of Halliday and millions of people use the Oasis, how am I supposed to believe that the main character is the ONLY one driving the Delorean  from Back to the Future? It’s one of the most popular movie cars ever, everyone would be driving it.  It would be like the Camry of the Oasis.
Glad to see that Tye Sheridan's legs aren't freakishly long in this trailer.
It looks what a fanboy would want for their perfect film.

Filled with their favorite characters fighting each other and all directed by Spielberg

Consider me hyped to the max. 

Wait... was that a Back to the Future call back at the end of the trailer? That little twinkle... 
Re: the "Joining the revolution" dialogue from the trailer. I'm trying to remember if there was some sort of revolution happening in the book. I mean there was the general everybody else hates the big bad corporate Sixers in the game, but it looked like the dialogue happens in the real world and I don't remember a real-world revolution. It might be just referencing fighting the Sixers in-game, but I get the feeling they're going to introduce a Hunger Games style real-world revolt.

I also get the impression that they're going to introduce the real Artemis much sooner in the movie than in the book. 
Back to the Future is one of the only things in my entire life that I’ve consistently had a love and passion for. Seeing the Delorean and hearing the music in a new movie makes my heart race and fills me with childish excitement. I cannot fucking wait to see this.
Woah, Spy Kids 3D looks a lot better than I remember.

Really not sure about this.

Hoping for the best but it looks like an un-inspired nostalgia-fest.
This could either be amazing or just a bunch of pandering "You get this reference, don't you gamers?" Hopefully it isn't the latter.

This must be the most teenage bait trailer I have ever seen.
Yeah it will be. Even from the early scripts and how it inherited the race scene here, alot will be changed. Hopefully it pays off
That could be a good thing.
That's a good thing. The books has some neat ideas, but does not hold up to much scrutiny. They could flesh out a lot here and still have a really thin, just fun movie.
I think the whole 80’s nostalgia thing which is about half the book will be given 5-10 minutes of screen time at most.

That was my first thought as well. This looks like it's going to just be a bunch of CGI crap all over the place with no story. 
step 1: take a book that monetizes the 80s

step 2: put everything from the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s

step 3: ???

step 4: $$$
That means the adaptation is accurate lol
yup
I recommend first season of Bloodline. Never seen someone play a villain so well on TV.
Like the next Christopher Lee, hope he doesn't choke on those aspirations.
Animal Kingdom (the film). He's terrifying
Place Beyond The Pines. Go watch it if you haven’t seen it. It’s like an epic version of Drive. 

I have no idea how it never got more popular. Has him in it, as well as Ryan Gosling, Bradley Cooper, Eva Mendez, Ray Liotta.

Well, the climactic battle in the book heavily features giant robots, so probably.
Superman....






/Weeps manly tears.

I don't wanna see him fight! He's not a gun!
But... the whole point of The Iron Giant was that him going all-out attack mode was terrible and a perversion of his gentle nature.
in the book the final battle involves a bunch of giant robots. 
**Easter Eggs: The Movie**
Whoever had to work on the legal team for this movie deserves a medal.  They probably had to go through so much paperwork to get the rights and permission for all this stuff.
I hope they keep in mind that since this takes place in the year 2045 Overwatch would be considered just as retro as, say, Super Mario Bros. nowadays.
CHEERS, LUV; THE CAVALRY'S HERE


[yep.](https://i.imgur.com/Xm0toUg.jpg)
that was definitely tracer. also on the right i'm pretty sure it's a girl from a fighter game. (can't remember the name)
It looks as if Mark Rylance got really high on a skype call and read some lines from the script while wearing a wig he had lying around, and then they just decided to go with it.
I mean, he's a socially awkward computer programmer who's also dying. I feel like that's what they were going for.
In the book his character is a real bad shut in so it makes sense he's not at all good at speaking publicly, even if it's a recorded message. Then again, I only know that from reading the book 
He sounds exactly what I'd imagine a 70 year old, shut-in, tech entrepreneur to sound like while reading his will. 
He's on his death bed. 
Pretty sure that's Deathstroke and not Deadpool which makes sense because Warner Bros owns that character.
Half of the end credits will be copyright lawyers
Disney and Warner Bros gets you probably 90% of the movie and tv stuff they'd use and they both have great relationships with Steven Speilberg.

It basically amounts to Speilberg making a few hundred phone calls over a week to get everything wrangled in. I think most people would fall over themselves to be in this eras pop culture reference movie.
AND JESUS WEPT
What episode was that?
In the book, there's a gaint robot fight with many of the most OP mecha ever.
TETSUUUOOOO!

Perfect timing is perfect
Tracer, Chun Li, Rocket, and Lara Croft in the corner there, all in one frame. I would hate to be the guy who had to deal with all of the paperwork for this movie.
One tricking confirmed. 
I CLAPPED. I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW ALL THE REFERENCES. 


ENDLESS TRASH!
The Movie
The references are fun though and nobody in Hollywood could get away with using them like Spielberg.
Stuff in the Oasis still costs money.  It is still a have vs havenot society.  In the book, Wade has little to no Oasis experience outside of school because he cannot afford to go places in the game.  He also isn't the only one driving a Delorean, but the author did not take a lot of time to describe every other vehicle we could potentially see on screen.  Plus, we may be seeing a few "chosen one" tropes going on.
By the time of the events in the film, "80's mania" had died down considerably, since no progress had been made on the quest after several years.  

*edit*  In the book, he explains that he got the car as a quest reward on the planet "Zemeckis" so  who knows.
It looks like what most of us would do if given unlimited access to VR.

That's absolutely fucking awful, like wtf.
This was like reading a textbook... completely unengaging 
Oh it definitely was a BTTF reference, especially since Alan Silvestri is doing the score for this film!
I heard that too! I believe it is.
[deleted]
Well in the book there is real-world action taken against IOI. They might play that up more in the movie. It might also be a sarcastic line.
Yeah so stoked for that. Between this and Stranger Things 3 in 2019, BttF is gonna be getting so much love in the next lil bit
100% yes. The DeLorean is one of my all time favourite things and seeing it in these 2 trailers fills me with so much joy. 

Cannot fucking wait! 
What if in the final battle, all the characters from Spy Kids arrive with their 3d glasses?
that movie was the fucking bomb
Every time the racing is brought up in these trailers I'm instantly reminded of the fucking badass Spy kids racing scene. Those were some cool bikes and juicy action.
Unfortunately it's a movie.  You might also have noticed that Art3mis's real life counterpart is in no way similar to the character's appearance as described in the novel.
He began the book overweight.
Well the book basically was a nostalgia fest
>un-inspired nostalgia-fest.

This was exactly what the book was, on top of being poorly written. 
Why would it be anything but the latter?

This movie looks like it has absolutely no heart and soul at all.
I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE THING BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT THAT IS!

et cetera et cetera...
FUCKIN IDIOTS COMMENTING ABOUT THE TRAILER IN THE TRAILER'S COMMENT SECTION
"Welcome to the resistance" run by no more than 10 teenagers. As is tradition.
And the "If you're watching this, I'm dead" thing
Yeah what is the whole race scene about? It's definitely not in the book, but they showed it a lot. I assume it's going to be one of the key challenges?
Jurassic Park is debatably a totally different story and is heralded as a classic lol. I trust SS.
I just finished reading the book.  I hated everything about it except the world-building.  So I'll take the dystopian world and the virtual reality with everything else changed, and be super happy about it.
I feel alot of the 80's references will be dropped and instead be 90's references. 
But Lieutenant Wade you ain’t got no legs.
Maybe a little later in the story. 

**Light spoiler**

They have to make him go from fairly average, to gaining a lot of weight, to somewhat buff. It's just easier if they have him start as normal as he looks here, and then have a segment when he lets himself go. 

I mean he's an actor, therefore already too attractive to play this role accurately without a ton of extra production work that isn't at all vital to the story. 
But remember he got super buff in the book because it was so important to the story and not just masturbatory nerd fantasy

How did that long leg make it thru to 'print'??? Didn't anyone notice that?!  I'm sure he/she is getting lots of shit today.
The fact that execs are just letting him make a real soundtrack that pays homage to some of his best work bodes well for the watching experience, even if the script turns out to be middling. It's been a while since I've watched a Hollywood movie with a decent soundtrack that wasn't just blaring noise.

Besides that, what videogame, movie, music, and cartoon characters will be in this?

Speilberg: yes 
Yep, that's definitely Tracer. Running next to Chun-Li from Street Fighter.
Are we gonna see Iron Giant vs a Gundam?
There was a moment I had to rewind and say "IS THAT TRACER?! THAT'S TRACER! WHAT?!" 
Tracer got me hyped, and they made one of the robots the Iron Giant.

There will be some liberties taken from the source material, but it feels like they're all fan service liberties.
Ahh, I thought that was the bird from final fantasy
Would make sense. I'm sure there was a part in the book involving the Joust game.

Which would be an extremely faithful screenplay, as the book was just a bunch of product references tossed in a bowl with barely enough story to make it stick together.
[deleted]
The book already had stuff from other decades, like the Iron Giant. Halliday was obsessed with the 80s, but the story does take place in 2045. 
its fun because we recognize it
And yet he's arguably the most likable character.
Yeah that is where I first discovered him. Too bad it was the only good season of that show
He plays a sadistic fuck in Animal Kingdom. I think that's what put him on the map. 
"The title *Ready Player One* is taken from a phrase in video games. The main character of the movie plays video games."
Betting right now that the Iron Giant dies dramatically during that battle so we get gut-punched by that again.
Suuuupeerrrrmmaaaaaannn (closes eyes and we all cry)
I'm so glad. He wasn't specifically mentioned as one of the available robots, but he fits there, so I'll allow it.

Hell, I'm actually incredibly glad they put him in.
Ooooh, I hope they bring the Jaegers, Gundams, Evangelions and even Transformers for that scene

Edit: changed **or** to **and** to fit the theme of this movie
I hope there's a Megazord in there somewhere.

Scratch that, Megazord**s**.
Mecha Godzilla is there right? I struggled reading the book, the ending got all blurry for me
Basically Garrys Mod the movie lol
Wreck-It Ralph: Live!
The movie comes out Easter weekend.
With how few media companies there are, they're probably all under the same umbrella. Like The LEGO Movie having DC superheroes, TMNT, Lord of the Rings characters, and so on, they're all just WB characters.
I could not believe they even decided to make it a movie with all of the pop culture references. When I was reading it I thought "pfft they could never make this into a movie. The copyrights alone would kill it." I am glad I was wrong.
No other director but Spielberg could have directed this. His name carries so much weight that any other director would have meant half this shit wouldn't have made it in. 

Side note though I'm so hype for a Gundam on the big screen. 
It feels even more impressive than Roger Rabbit must have been.
Yes and no.

It's a movie targeted for geekdom, chock full of relevant product placement.

If you look at it it from that perspective, the things that stand out the most are things that are still relevant today. Tracer, Chun Li, the Gundam towards the end in two pretty lengthy shots for the trailer.

Everything that is still relevant and sold today, whether it's part of a game or a line of products is basically paying for itself. The movie probably has an advertisement deal with all those companies. The non-modern stuff is relegated to the background. Did you notice FemShep next to and slightly behind Tracer?

And i don't mind one bit. I love me some fucking Gundam.
Yes, BUT, in the book Halliday was specifically obsessed with/loved the 1980s, as that's when he was a kid.

And behind Tracer is Lara Croft.
I never did picture the Halliday vid like that but im interested to see the full take on it here. In the book the full video had a lot of magical effects and transitions and all that so i wonder if that will be present
In the book I think he also has Asperger's or autism or something like that, so it makes perfect sense
Yeah, they talk about how Og did most of the interviews/pressers because Halliday was so fucking awkward and didn't like to talk to people.
I think I remember the message being incredibly goofy, with him dancing and stuff, no?
It is Deathstroke. In the first trailer you can clearly see him and Harley walking out together. 
You are correct.

Steven Spielberg modern political-drama.

Consider me sold.
Are you insinuating this guy predicted the darkest time line, and we're carving the path?
Also people don't much care about the presidency because everyone lives their lives inside the Oasis, and the real world has gone to shit anyway so they don't see the point.
yeah 3 months too late
Perfect timing would have been a few months ago. The vote is this week. 
Probably not as bad as you'd think. Just contact Disney for anything Time Warner doesn't own. Disney basically has everything else.
Plus, probably everyone has a delorian phase. Most people eventually move on. I'd get one for a while, batmobile, Akira bike, magic school bus, mystery machine, tank girl's tank, Howarts Express, Thomas the train, a giant Tiger,  Herbie, Santa's sleigh, Voltron... I think Howl's moving Castle is where I'd settle down, in more ways than one. 
I believe he won the delorean by completing a BttF quest, actually. Theres a whole paragraph in the book where he describes how he got it and all of the modifications he made to it, making it some sort of  80s super-nostalgia-car that became his “signature”. I could find the part in the book of needed.
You missed your chance to be a beloved literary giant.


The 80s still hold up even after 10 years since it's premiere.
The early parts of the book are terrible. It only picks up when the wank-fest ends and the story begins, really.
and not to mention, Spielberg produced the movies
And Wade travels around in an Ecto-88; a Delorean with Ghostbusters decals and KITT programming.
 they might just be referring to the Grunters as a whole being the revolution, which they kinda were
One of the latest episodes of Mr. Robot had so much BttF love
What does Stranger Things 3 has to do with BttF? I've not kept up with the news.
The DeLorean factory was about 5 minutes drive from my house.  The old banked test track is still there and I got to drive it earlier this year which was cool.
But why male models?
which annoyed me. It's not the deepest book but one aspect of Ready Player One that was interesting was how people portray themselves online vs real life. 

[Art3mis was notable in the book because the author made sure to note that the only thing she had changed about herself was her birthmark. That was a big part of her character...that her birthmark was the cause of her low selfesteem and her discomfort in revealing herself to others.](#spoiler)
It's been a while since I read it, but isn't she supposed to be [overweight and black?](#spoiler)

Edit: Thinking of Aech. Thanks guys. I need to reread this damn book. So good.
I was confused to see Wade interacting with her, seemingly frequently, in real life.  A major theme of the book is Wade's, and society at large, social isolation in the real world. He only physically interacts with people at the beginning of the book and the end.
I've gotta admit, I'm annoyed that they didn't cast a curvier actress for Art3mis.
The character of Artemis was a dumb niceguy™ fantasy anyway. Beautiful girl with minor facial birthmark so that the average socially incapable guy can feel superior enough to date her.

I'm lazy but someone else surely has bookmarked that poem by Ernest Cline where he explains his perfect woman, it's cringy as fuck. I'm a huge fan of the book, but it's portrayal of Artemis as a woman is borderline unfilmable.
It's I understand that reference: The Book.
The premise is pretty great though. It looks like they're massively rewriting parts of the story and that's a good sign. It's great material for someone like Spielberg to elevate.

For example, Jaws is a shitty book and Gone Girl is an above average beach book, but the films are 10/10s.
Thank god I scrolled down far enough to find my people. Jesus it was a tough book to get through
That basically describes the entire book too.
IT BROKE BEW GROUND!!
REMEMBER THE EIGHTIEEEEESSSS!???!!!??
The Breakfast Club running a revolution.

Classic.
Cmon if you were a multi trillionaire you would wanna leave behind a video like that.
Unfortunately that's the very reason the plot kicks off. The book is fun but has some annoying tropes and Family Guy-ish reference humor.
I'm actually really okay with this. Thinking back to the book, most of the actual challenges boiled down to either playing arcade games or miming old movies, neither of which would translate well to the screen.
Banners at the race say "Copper Key" so it is clearly linked somehow. TBH a race is way more interesting than acting out an entire 80s movie like happens a few times in the book.
I mean, one of the biggest things people are relating to is The Iron Giant
[deleted]
Yeah, I've read it a few times now and couldn't agree more.  OASIS as a concept, the fun pop culture references, and some of the puzzle solving is really entertaining but, man, are the characters and story some middle school grade, cringe worthy stuff.  Good popcorn read, will definitely catch this movie.
Then read Snowcrash next.
or 10's references. I saw Tracer in there. Not exactly nostalgic, but hey there it is.
Lieutenant Wade’s got magic legs
shoulda casted christian bale. Thats all I'm saying.
Guarantee this won’t be in the film. He’s gonna be the same size the entire movie 
Finally a Fantastic Four movie that looks good.
Bruh
Now I get it

The egg is the one piece
Wait... really? Is that *actually* the original?
I wonder if that leg is an obscure reference to something
Thank you for this walk down memory lane
I'm 95% sure I saw Chucky kicking ass.
And the Iron Giant charging at the very end!
What a time to be alive.
Also Lara Croft is there as well.
Fem Sheppard from mass effect is behind them too
And directly behind Tracer is default FemShep from Mass Effect 3
Don't forget about the gundam and the Iron Giant!
Not any Gundam. But none other than RX-78-2. Hoping for an Amuro Ray cameo.
Maybe not those two fighting each other, but possibly against Mechagodzilla, like in the book.
[deleted]
>I had to ~~rewind~~ recall and say
I’ve never played overwatch but she’s kinda like pikachu is for Pokémon and is extremely recognizable and yellow so even I know who she is. I thought I just saw someone similar looking.
Hopefully there will be some Chocobo Races. 
I didn't spot any chocobos
Joust was the trial to get the copper key
To be fair, nobody likes to lead an army that's marching backwards. 
"Number 6 is highly improbable"
Oh hell is the Iron Giant gonna fight an RX-78-2?!
Gundamnit! 
This is no Zaku, boy! No Zaku!
Hopefully it will be combating the Gundam and Iron Giant
And Mecha Godzilla. I pray he's still in.
THE OG-G
You mean a GOOD Gundam movie.
Yes... 

But I assume that's just paying out the nose to everyone who ever created any IP ever made in the 1980's.  Ever.

The movie is a gigantic cash-out for anyone who made anything for a full decade (more, from the looks of it).

that's not a 'bad thing'.  Nostalgia is fun, and that's okay.

If you've read the book [you know that's the whole point of it all, and what made it fun to fans.  The story is super simple, but well put-together.](#spoiler)
I seriously doubt they're just throwing all this stuff in without clearing the rights first.
too soon man
It's gonna be great
What is it with Ricks?
AT-ST! AT-ST!

IT BROKE  NEW GROUND!!!!!!
lol that's the entire movie
Seriously everyone in his family where assholes to him. Cant help but feel sorry for him.
If you pay close attention, you’ll see a brief glimpse of a 1980’s Delorian, a subtle nod to the 1980’s classic, Back to the Future. 
BRAVO!
Only if they get Vin Diesel to voice him again.
DON'T DO THIS TO ME AGAIN THAT WAS MY FAVORITE MOVIE AS A KID
you stay, 

i go
If I remember right, the villains got Mechagodzilla, and then the five zords and five Voltron lions. 
main villain used  Mecha Godzilla
just less yelling and swearing
HAAAAAAAXXXX
The Cameo Holiday Special
Niiiice. A movie about easter egg hunting, o Easter? Finally, an Easter movie beyond Hop!
If I recall Lego owns all the rights to the Lego version of all the characters 
I'm sure Spielberg managed to sell the idea to a lot of owners and companies. It wasn't some random director's project, and he was able to get a lot more yesses just coming from himself than would normally happen.
To be fair, I'm sure most properties rights owner are not asking money to put their IP in that movie or even paying money. It's basically like product placement. Plus plenty of those are owned by Warner anyway.
Only happened because they agreed to give WB and Disney characters equal screentime. I'm hoping LEGO can do the same thing and we'll have the proper avengers VS Justice League movie we deserve
In the book, various players have actually ported entire "classic" video games and movies into various worlds. Off the top of my head, there was definitely a Warcraft, Star Wars, and Bladerunner "worlds" off the top of my head.
Yeah, but not everyone in the Oasis was, and you can be anything, so it's largely irrelevant, as long as Tracer isn't a part of his game to control the Oasis.
Don't forget Lara Croft on the left.
Chun Legs*
If I recall, this is the role that Spielberg wanted Gene Wilder to come out of retirement for before his death... would have been fitting.
I kind of pictured an older looking Tony Stark. Then, when he transformed into his younger self, it reminded me of that scene where Tony Stark appeared as his younger self too. 
It starts off with a dance scene then it becomes like a 1 on 1 sit down type chat.

I can see someone making fun of him having a DeLorean because it's like a starter car for people in that world 
I'd get KITT from Knight Rider.
I think some of those wouldn't work as a car. Voltron, for example, is a giant mecha in the book. there's still some semblance of practicality to the of things.  For my land car, I would probably use Speed Racer's car. For my mech, Unit 02. For my space ship, I'd probably pick one of the real life ones. For my base of operations, clearly a death star. 
Yes, I could have been a literary giant like George R.R. Martin, J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, Michael Crichton, Stephen King, R.L. Stine, or Andy Weir. 
And not to mention that big fuckin' DeLorean in race at the start. 
yay a second person who watches Mr. Robot :)
No. No. No! A social outcast wears glasses.  A male model *doesn't* wear glasses.

I think people are forgetting these things.

Jurassic Park wasn't exactly the Great American Novel or anything. Spielberg is out to tell engaging stories, and he does it well.

This is not going to be a serious movie in the way that people *want* it to be, if that makes sense. This is going to be a Jaws or a JP kind of Spielberg film. It's going to be fun, but done extremely well.
There's literally a part where everyone claps for the protagonist after he flexes his pop culture knowledge at some "poser"
That's not true, there's also a lot of lists.
*Rich Evans' laughter in the background*
 Dear Leaders of our Dystopic society, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole lifetime in poverty for whatever it is that we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms and the most convenient definitions. 

But what we found out is that each one of us is a messiah. And a loveable rogue. And a comic relief. A cheerleader. And a traitor to the cause who ultimately sacrifices himself in order to save the cause and plotline.

Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.
Even if I wasn't a trillionaire I'd love to leave a video like that.  Video wills are awesome.
It would be kinda funny if the first act of the film ends with them just playing the entirety of WarGames with Tye Sheridan poorly green-screened in as Broderick's character.  
There's a lot of stuff in the book that won't translate well to screen so I'm okay with them making a bunch of changes, especially with the challenges that he has to do for the keys which in my opinion were the weakest parts of the story
They mention Iron Giant as one of the mech choices in the book, so since the movie is being produced by Dreamworks, Wades probably going to  conveniently make the Iron Giant as his choice mech. Also because no one will recognize the Japanese spider man mech that he chooses in the book.

Edit: from other comments it actually looks like Iron man is replacing Ultraman and the Gundam mech is replacing The Supaidaman mech 
And much better writing also
Just curious, if you found it to be so poorly contrived and cringey, with so many good books out there, why would you read it more than once, let alone more than *twice*?   
  
I really enjoyed it for what it was, but let's be honest here, it's basically Twilight for nerds.
> the fun pop culture references

They're not so much references as they are lists that go on for a fucking quarter page.  

"I strapped on my sword from the Legend of Zelda (the original NES version), then climbed on top of my Speeder Bike from Return of the Jedi (1983) and blasted off down the street to the OCP building from Robocop. Inside I found a room that was filled with comics, video games, action figures and movie posters. I will now list those, too."
If you enjoy the world, but not the plot, I'd definitely suggest Snow Crash!
The book as a whole is a really cool concept but reads like it was written by a 12-year-old.
Well, the movie is set in 2045, and while the Oasis has a strong 80's pop culture vibe due to its creator, there's no reason it would be completely exclusive to other stuff. 
Lieutenant Wade, ice cream.


I bet Christian Bale could have lost the 10-15 years needed to fit the role no problem.
I'm afraid if Christian Bale puts himself through that sort of thing again he won't survive it
Four Fantastic Limbs
As far as I know, yeah. That's the actual poster.
Chucky ass kicking verified...
Supermannnnn....
Suuupermaaan
Iron Giant sold me
It's like the modern version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
I hope Char will make a cameo too, but I highly doubt it.
Not just the RX-78-2 but the RX-78-2 ver Ka, which was a redesign for the Model Kits. It is the best version of the RX-78-2.
Fuck that give me Burning Gundam on Fuunsaiki http://moarpowah.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fuunsaiki.jpg
For a moment I forgot Warner Bros (who are making Ready Player One) has the rights to Godzilla in the west and not just Legendary Pictures. Holy shit we better get Mechagodzilla.
Evah get that feelin of deyjavu
> marching backwards 

Reminds me of my favorite exchange in a videogame:

> Starscream: I have never retreated! EVER!

> Grindor: Of course not. You simply *advance backwards*.

> [Starscream screams in anger]

Revenge of the Fallen: the Game. More fun than the movie, but that's not saying much. 
"Number 5 is alive"
Fuck nah they're gonna be blowin' shit up on the same team, homie
r/whowouldwin is gonna have a field day with this movie.

[They do. Its Mecha Godzilla and the Evangelions vs every other mecha ever](#spoiler)
> If you've read the book you know that's the whole point of it all, and what made it fun to fans. The story is super simple, but well put-together.

And yet the comments are full of people complaining that it reads like it was written by a twelve year old. You can still dump nostalgia references and have good writing and storytelling.
It's like it rhymes. It's like poetry
You ruined this too?!
DRIVING A DELOREAN.  I'M GONNA CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM
Those vistas tho
I haven’t seen this trailer yet! Did the check clear? It did? Great! I loved this trailer! I was pounding my fists on the chable the entire time with excitement!
IT'LL BREAK NEW GROUND!
Please clap.
AT-ATs!!!! 

Oh wait no, Disney did not agree to lend their licences...
The game-like CGI combined with live-action footage suggests the story takes place in two worlds: a game world and the real world. You can tell because of the way it is.
Oh my god, I didn't even see that. Nice catch!
*I am Superman*
They did.
*Suuuperman.*
And also all the Evangelion units too.
God, seeing that on film is going to be _epic._ 
It won’t be on YouTube either. 
I can't imagine that's entirely true, since there were no Marvel or Disney characters, and LEGO has stuff for both of them.
Yeah, when Steven Spielberg calls and wants to use your character in his next big budget blockbuster, his first sci-fi movie since ~~Minority Report~~ War of theWorlds too, I can't imagine anyone saying no to that.
Nintendo, please approach the next Smash like this. 
Yeah, there was an entire virtual Azeroth.  Not surprising that someone would have made an Overwatch world. 
Yes, correct, I was commenting specifically about the retro thing.  It isn't that stuff is retro, it's what each individual was interested in.
Regardless we know tracer will be there cause heroes never die
That might also be FemShep between Tracer and Chun Li.
Thicc thighs end lives
That would have been magical, no pun intended. 
The VR episode is in the Yahoo season so it's less well known than the video game one.. 

Also the game episode was a battle for wealth, a competition... 
The VR episode was the dean feeling like god because this terrible operating system made directory structure into "world's within world's!"  . Lol I love the dean.
Jesus fuck don't tease me. 
bro that's Kaneda`s bike
> who knows what will happen in the future

Well according to the movie, skyscrapers will be made by stacking mobile homes.
Not yet...
Oh I missed that one, kinda subtle.
The Clark Kent effect.
spoiler alert
i was so confused to who you guys were talking about. I listened to the audiobook so i thought it was "H" not Aech
*tips poetry fedora*
"these women aren't women, they're silicone objects"

"men who like then are mysoginists"

Nice
To be fair, it was in a chatroom full of gunters. Not much different from reddit. In fact, that happens on reddit all the time.
One of the many parts where I cringed myself inside-out. It was a tough book to finish
Followed by 45 minutes of Joust. 
I want so badly for this to happen.
Thank you! The key challenges were so boring while they should have been the most exciting parts. Page after page of our hero finding the first area where the key is located, and then the challenges he faces are brushed off in one sentence. Then its time to play an arcade game for a few pages. It stunted any enjoyment I got from the book. I think the movie will far exceed the book considering the people involved.
> There's a lot of stuff in the book that won't translate well to screen

Well there were a lot of things in the book that didn't translate well as book, that are gonna translate well in a movie, so it even out I say.

I mean things like all the references - they had to be explained in the book, in the movie they can just sit there and it's gonna feel way more rewarding to see it and recognize it than to read: "And at is side were Tracer, from the popular game Overwatch"
It's not a bad alternative. Iron Giant has become an iconic figure despite the movie just doing okay originally. IG could easily become a powerhouse character in time.
Except he hadn't figured out how to end a book yet at that point in his writing career
My go-to term has been "Neckbeard Twilight" much to the disdain of my friends who love the book.
That's not a joke, either. I feel like future readers should know that going in. The author lists EVERYTHING. Which is okay, but damn does the story drag. I heard the audiobook version with Wil Wheaton and hearing him read off the score board several times made me want to rip my hair out. Not that it was Wil's fault, it's just that the author really does drag out the minute details.
"Lets see how many I can shoehorn in to a chapter. It's not even a reference, more as you said, just a fucking list, and it really ruined the read for me. Took me out of the world.
Did you know that Christian Bale gained 6 months right after The Machinist to play Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins.
Were there really two shots of a gundam though?
Hm. I wonder who the executive producer was for that
If that happens and it gains a lot of popular momentum from fans, I guarantee you they'll start talking about making a proper live action Gundam movie. With any luck, helmed by Del Toro.
Looks like the 3.0/Real Life version to me.  
The Ver. Ka one doesn't have cross on the shield, and it has those things on the shoulder.  
The decal work is clearly real life version.
cheeuhs lahv
I spent so much time playing that games multiplayer. For a movie game, it was honestly pretty good.
Doctors hate number 4!
Mambo number 5
Hold up. Does [Warner Bros have rights to Godzilla in the west, or do they just distribute it while Legendary holds the rights? Mecha-G battle please](#spoiler).
Holy fuck that sounds awesome 
Wait really? Evangelions are going to be in it?
Really the book gets by on it's world building more than it's nostalgia. not that that's not a major part. The issues are with the shallow characters themselves being poorly written. 
does anybody want a pizza roll? leave a comment on my webzone if you want a pizza roll
I KNOW WHAT THAT IIIIIIS
Very cool, very cool. 
**ENDLESS TRAAASH!!**
If this film let's me see a Evangelion kick the shit out of a Metal Gear I will buy 15 copies of this film
Did they have their actual abilities? Because there's some huge discrepancies in power here.
Holy shit I love Evangelion.
Get in the ~~robot~~ theater Shinji!
If thats even how it happens. 
If your standards are low enough, it can be.
There were Han and Lando aboard the Millenium Falcon. And they are Disney. 
There's a Lego Avengers show on netflix. They weren't in the movies (AFAIK), but they definitely have some sort of agreement with the mouse. 
Final season was a great send off 
"And Jesus wept!"

In the book, it was cheaper to do that than build skyscrapers. I don't want to spoil the reason why, but population density is far more important due to things that have changed. 
They should show him play an entire perfect game of Pacman.
complete with the bony finger constantly clicking on the flap button.
Don't forget playing Pacman for hours to get a perfect score.
Luckily i had a 6 week Joust tournament with Aech

Oh thank god I've seen War Games 80 times

Oh look at me, mr pac man expert
I agree with you. It seems that a lot of the changes they are making are for the best. While the book was not perfect, it did have a really intriguing premise and I think that Steven Spielberg is the perfect director to take on this project.
I love the book too but I don't think pretending it's high-brow literature is really doing anyone any favors.
I love the book, but I fully acknowledge that it's nostalgia porn. When anyone asks, that's exactly how I describe it, and that's everything that I love about it.
Harsh. *Most appropriate,* but harsh.
Henry Weinstein.  Didn’t you see the potted plants?
>a proper live action Gundam movie.

Oh god I hope it isn't going to be a huuuuge clusterfuck like the one movie that shall not be named...


...and number 3 is an ad. 
Google images for "Ready Player One fanart" and that will give you a vague idea of things that happened.
I CLAPPED WHEN THEY MADE A REFERENCE 

[Sequels like a retard]
The fate of the movie is gonna take place in the mind of the main character as everyone's turned into period blood.
You have to take into consideration that it's that group vs literally *millions* other gamers, all with their own tools, weapons, and a few other iconic giant mechs (including Spider-man's!).
With how restrictive Toho is about licensing of their characters, I have my doubts MechaGodzilla is in it. But I will gladly eat my words if he is in the movie.
Casting and planning was done before they Disney bought Lucasfilm, so the deal was likely made when it was just Lucasfilm.
Watching the Dean "delete" the file by drowning it in the virtual pool was so great
Taking 15 minute breaks by using an exploit to eat pizza and go to the bathroom 
Playing a perfect game of Pacman *virtually in a VR arcade!*
And it's filmed in one single continuous take. For legitimacy.
On a serious note, it looks like we won't be getting that. Its a shame, because the whole point of the copper key section was to show that years had gone past and only dedicated fans were looking for the key now. Looks like in the film it'll start just as a race, which is a shame.
To be fair, nobody in the book just *happened* to have these particular interests and skill sets. Halliday created the Easter egg and left his journal so that people would be kinda forced into mastering all the shit he was into if they wanted to stand a chance. It was years before anyone made any headway at all into the quest. 
You're probably right. I enjoyed the concept so much, but I just hated the writing. There were so many narrative choices that I would've done the opposite way. But I've never written a novel, so my opinion doesn't carry any clout. Very much looking forward to the film adaption, however.
Directed by Sean Spielberg 
You mean Harvey.
Speaking of...where’s that Macross live-action??
Number 2 is paywalled.
VERY COOL.
> The fate of the movie is gonna take place in the mind of the main character as everyone's turned into ~~period blood~~ Tang.



Speilberg has some stroke and I don't think Toho will want to be the one left out what looks like the modern era version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

I got a feeling people are probably falling over themselves to get 1 second of a walk by for their property in this film.
Probably why there's no Disney stuff in Lego Dimensions 
The whole movie should just be Tye Sheridan reading the book.
This is the director's cut we need! 
VRcade
I thought Wade might be in the classroom scene as a kid
Right, none of that bothered me because it's made pretty clear that the characters have spent a shitload of time doing everything 80s, so while they happen to be very good at the challenges presented, it's pretty clear that they'd be very good at any challenges based on 80s stuff. Maybe I'm too easy on it, but I never got the feeling of the main character just incidentally being an expert at all of the requisite things.
It got cancelled after they spent all their budget on extra missles.
And of course, #1 was Reddit hugged to deathed.
She had NO IDEA her Number 1 was showing!!!!
Numer 1 is ready, oh wait that's a player
[deleted]
Figured that was because Disney had their own toys-to-life thing at the time.
No, they should have Wil Wheaton by himself up there acting out every scene of the book
It's also not fatal for a story -- it is convenient that all of James Bond's gadgets are applicable to upcoming situations but fair enough. We roll with it.
Except for that hacking part in infiltrating the big bad corporation.
Number 0 is where arrays start
I'm going to go watch Half in the bag's Rogue One episode now
