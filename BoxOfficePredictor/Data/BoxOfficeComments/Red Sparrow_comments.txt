This kinda reminds me of Salt but maybe a bit darker (?).
I remember being excited for this film a couple years back when they were looking at David Fincher to direct and Rooney Mara to star in it. Hopefully this movie will to turn out to be pretty good.
https://imgur.com/a/TLyC4 - that's like 500 rubles max. 

So you can get a night with Jennifer Lawrence for less than $10. Nice attention to details from creators of this movie. /s
It's Hollywood casting again. In the book It's suppose to be a young man, older woman pairing. She's looks pretty good though.

I bet we're saving the dodgy russian accent until nearer to the release date.
Putin is a pretty big character in the books, should be interesting how there going to show that

So, Francis Lawrence directed the last three Hunger Games movies, so this means, this is the fourth time that he worked together with Jennifer Lawrence who is by the way, is not related to each other.

[I think they show a different trailer on Cinemacon. Because description from the Cinemacon is different from this trailer.](http://deadline.com/2017/03/jennifer-lawrence-red-sparrow-20th-century-fox-cinemacon-trailer-1202056041/)

> Rich in gold, red and fall tones, we see Lawrence’s Dominika Egorova weathering a severe leg injury onstage. She recovers and is given the chance in a lush hotel bar “to become special again” by a Russian intel officer. Charlotte Rampling’s voice-over carries the rest of the trailer as we see shots of the snow, and the French-designed estates of Russia.
> 
> “You will be schooled in psychological manipulation. Every human is a puzzle of need. You will be trained to determine target’s weakness and exploit that weakness through seduction. From this moment forward you will become sparrows, weapons of Russia.”
> 
> Then Rampling tells Lawrence’s protag, “If you can’t be of service to the state, I’m to put a bullet through your head.” The movie can’t get here soon enough. The last part of the title card flashes “Now in production.”



The Tagline is also reminds me of Edge of Tomorrow: "Seduce. Deceive. Repeat."
A pack of 100 Ruble bills for a prostitute, a woman named Dominika, a secret government assassin training facility... Oh, can't wait. Hollywood trying to show Russia and Russians is always a joy to watch. It's mostly so dumb and and disrespectful you can't help but laugh. 
Just to be that guy; the book series this is adapted from is amazing. Written by a spy, after 35 years service, and so in depth. 

I just hope the adaption is as good and I'm feeling pretty good from this trailer.
It has Matthias Schoenaerts? Sounds like a cool cast but the trailer looks kind of mediocre.
Doesn't look very compelling. I do like the actors though.

Atomic Blonde couldn't convince me to go to the theater I don't think this one will either.
This movie looks so bad. Jennifer Lawrence is definetely miscast. She hardly passes of as a ballerina, and I'm sure her russian accent would be the worst in a long time. A stack of 100 rubles is an incredibly small amount of money, a starbucks drink would cost aproximately 200-500. I know it's adopted from a book, but the concept is really dump. So, now you can extract top secret information by having sex with someone? Interesting.
I'm most curious in that we don't get to see Jen utter a single line because I'm really curious about her Russian accent. This is also certainly a new type of role for her. 
I just finished reading this book.  I never pictured Jennifer Lawrence as the lead; it always seemed like it should be Alicia Vikander or someone more her body type, since the character's supposed to be a former ballerina.  I'm curious to see how much of a Russian accent she puts on as well.
You had me at Joel Edgerton + The writer of A Cure for Wellness

Fox made a Black Widow movie before Marvel  🤔
I like turtles.
I am predicting a plot twist: she changes sides does she?

Where is my paycheck Hollywood?
Jennifer Lawrence playing a Russian spy. Just the type of film that will make me rush to the cinemas.
Those Russians sure love to use sexy spies to get secrets out of the West. 
Looks like the movie will explain how Donald Trump's Russian pee tape came to be.
Katyaaa???
This is the guy who made Constantine! Trailer doesn't give away much but I'm excited. Looks lush. 
Kind of reminded me of Under the Skin.
First Jennifer Lawrence film that looks good in a while.
Cool. We're finally getting a Black Widow movie.
#BWAAAAAAAAAAA
Jlaw in that bathing suit wow...
Hollywood: "We heard you wanted a Black Widow movie, so here's that movie but without Black Widow." 
Looks interesting.
Holy shit, that looks great!
I like the concept, but I find most of the people involved in this underwhelming in practice. JL tends to sleepwalk through her action movies.
Oh, for some reason I thought it was coming out this year! That's too bad. Oh well. I love the cast, I need more of Matthias Schoenaerts in everything, please.
The fact that this was originally meant to be out this year, but pushed back into March 2nd of next year, one of the dump months for action movies, and a trailer that's dropped to ride the mother!/Jlaw media boost. Hm. Doesn't really sound promising.
Yeah, this is the type of role I'd like to see her in. Count me in! Sure it beats last year's *Passengers*....
looks interesting
Part of the Atomic Blonde cinematic universe?
woke up to gunshots in budapest one morning looked out my window and turns out they were filming this movie
Looks exactly like Salt. 
Looks like Under The Skin with plot.

edit: Removed "more."
This looks bad. And Lawrence is not a good actress- yet she still gets cast in six "big" movies a year.


She's not the most talented but JLaw is for sure taking some real interesting roles as of recent between this and mother!

By 2018 50% of hollywood movies will feature Jennifer Lawrence 
J.Law needs to shut up when she's not acting.                            

Another John Chick. Really???
The Americans: Origins
Had that exact same thought.  Someone's been gunning for this to be adapted and released before Marvel gets around to a Black Widow movie, I'm certain.
100%. As the trailer was running its all I could think of
"Nothing exists outside of superhero movies"
-r/movies
Definitely has a prequel vibe of Salt.
And a lot better.
Still secretly hoping for a Girl With The Dragon Tattoo sequel with Mara, Craig, and Fincher
I'm so glad it wasn't Rooney Mara. That girl is so wooden.
Maybe he already gave her the money and that's whats left :D
she is working for food 
There's multiple bills there, and we can't see what the others are. Could be multiple 5000ryb bills in there.
Ha ha ha- what a story Mark
I drinkЪ to you komrade
Hahahahaha dodgy Russian accent.  
I recently read the first two books and had the impression that both of the main characters were about the same age. I must have missed the clues about the age difference. 
Urg, really? That sucks they changed it then.
> It's Hollywood casting again

let it go..

let it go..

let it go..
Ah stfu
Is the book worth reading?
The "___ ___ repeat" thing is a pretty common saying in pop-culture, long predating Edge of Tomorrow.
Except for Eastern Promises. 
Dominika Egorova as russian name sounds like from some parody.
Klukva: The Movie.
>Written by a spy, after 35 years service

Fact that it was written by a spy doesn't mean squat when it comes to realism or accuracy

Example: story for game Ace Combat Assault Horizon was written by respected journalists

It was horseshit


Francis Lawrence is okay. The only movies that I really like from him is The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.

I actually find Lawrence to be a really frustrating director because he always shows moments of real promise and flair and in the end the result is always mediocre. I keep waiting for him to do something great and he never does. 
I think Jennifer is a bore, but I suppose I see why people thinks shes a big deal, sorta.
I smell a hint of sarcasm here.
Yeah, except a name like Dominica Egorova makes this movie impossible to take seriously. I can already see all the awful Russian stereotypes.
They had me at "take off your dress" 
The synopsis alone left me a bit conflicted. Lawrence is good at many things but "seductress" or "spy" aren't the things I think she's the best at.

But we'll see. She is an actress after all.
How.... how did you come to that conclusion last lol.
Ummm....mother
She is pretty hot
It was originally set for 2017 but it was pushed back a year
It was pushed back and will be out March 2nd, so make of that information what you will.
No it doesn't at all. Is it possible it was pushed to separate it from Atomic Blonde?
Well they did film it this year. Maybe they just didn't want to rush it. 
In this case, you're probably the only one drawing that comparison... looks nothing like atomic blonde and has a completely different concept.
Actually, there is nudity in this film it's one of the reasons why the movie is rated R, that and the violence. 
She was literally in one movie this year. Even the chubby kid from It did more.
Jane Wick sounds better.

Atomic Blonde 2: Electric Boogaloo
Salt: Origins

(Seriously, it's the same premise)
[deleted]
Russian Spy Cinematic Universe confirmed. At the end of the movie Angelina Jolie shows up to recruit Jennifer Lawrence to fight Charlize Theron's character in Atomic Blonde.
Original had 3 total movies, I thought the plan was to adapt all 3.
Fede Alvarez is rebooting the series with a new cast. Claire Foy was reported several months back to be the front runner to plays Salander.
*tetris theme plays*
"He gently fingered her waddle."
not older older, but there was suppose to be an old gap. Joels character is suppose to be naive. It's just odd to see a movie about a 27 year veteren seducing a 42 year old man
Why? Are we only only one opinion around here? Opposing opinions do get downvoted around here
Definitely worth reading, some of the best modern spy fiction.
Yes I think generally it is a play on the "lather, rinse, repeat" instructions on shampoo bottles.
Well that wasn't a hollywood film tbf
I see your point, and I would only suggest it's better than your average spy novel, but what experience do journalists have in combat?
As divisive it is, Constantine had some lush imagery. Admirable effort imo. 
I thought 'I am Legend" was really good. But I haven't seen it in a long time. Also a fan of 'Catching Fire.'
Catching Fire was an absolute joy. It was the first time in a long while that as soon as it ended I thought "I need to see it again."

Such a shame the other three films didn't instill that feeling in me.
Constantine was pretty dope too. Its been quite a while since we've actually had a good angels and demons movie.
He's got great style that he has a hard time reigning in to make something with substance. He can do action, but is not that good at drama.
A hint? 
It's the same name in the book.
If that was true why wouldn't they worry about the conflict with Proud Mary, another sexy blonde bob wig wearing spy/assassin movie coming out a month before this?
If that was the case they wouldn't dump it on March 2nd.
Seeing a mans ass enough causes an r rating.
I go to home
Which is strange as Scarlett Johanssen seems to be a box office draw. 
Feige has pretty much said it's a matter of when we get a Black Widow movie, not if. 
Problem is ScarJo can't hold a movie to save her life. She's great as a co-star, but not as a lead.
I'll allow it.
I thought they were doing another one.... but with a new cast and for the source material of the fourth book (for some stupid reason). 
Yeah I think that was the plan but it fell apart
Yep that's why I'm secretly hoping
War correspondent and foreign policy journalist to be more precise

It was big selling point in advertising for the game and well, it did not go the way production team hoped
Doesn't make it any less dumb if you're Russian, like I am. The only chance a Russian woman has to be called Dominica is if she's half-Latino or her parents are dumb.
Oh I'm not arguing. I wasn't aware there was another movie too. I just was aware of atomic blonde and figured it might have been a factor. This trailer is the first I've heard of red sparrow. 
[deleted]
Not in as a movie's lead. She sucks if she's at the center.
How do you figure? I don't see barely anyone as a box office draw anymore. I used to think Dwayne Johnson was one of the last stars who had box office draw but he was the lead star in 'Baywatch' and that flopped. ScarJo was the lead star in Ghost in the Shell and it was a box office flop. 

I don't think anyone is a box office draw/super-star anymore. At least not in western movies. If anyone is, it is directors (Nolan for example) that have draw no matter what the project looks like in a trailer. 
[deleted]
People say that she's a box office draw, but she had two bombs this year alone. :/
If Fincher is still directing I don't mind a new cast.
Or she is a hooker with a false name. It's popular among them. 
You dont follow the book, youre in trouble. You follow the book, youre in trouble.
I really don't buy this argument. My theory has an equal amount of assumption, but it feels more realistic. I don't think there's as much animosity between DC and Marvel as people think. They do sell different products, despite both being in the super hero business. There's not a good equivalent to Superman and Batman in the Marvel universe. Wonder Man is not Black Widow, either. 

I think, if anything, Marvel wanted to let DC break that ground first. Its not like Marvel is hurting in any way, financially, from the choice to push the black widow movie off till phase 3. Wonder Woman became the first female superhero success story and I think that's a great thing. I think Feige probably believes its a great thing, too. It 'feels' right to the overall arc of the growth of these movies on both sides.  They're in no rush to push the 'token female hero' and nor should they be. They're developing the character slowly over multiple movies, and that formula has served them well. 
Damn, guess they better not make it just because we already have a couple movies with a female lead!
Probably would have made one by now had ike perlmutter not been the end point of approval for the first half of the mcu. 
Disney is the most conservative movie studio.
Maybe they won't think of it as a party. Even if they did, their Black Widow still came before those standalone movies you mentioned.
It's a fact sh can't carry a movie. She's fine if she's not the main character.  
It's more of a criticism towards the book itself. I mean, is there really nobody like Tom Clancy anymore? He at least wasn't afraid to include good Russians with moral codes and realistic names. Case in point - Mikhail Arkadiyevich Popov in Rainbow Six. 
[deleted]
black widows barely has a character let alone development. Just a generic spy tbh.

I rather mcu focus on characters like Cap Marvel or maybe She Hulk
Preach brother! Women are a fad that will go away any day now.
lol you are a god.
OK, but how much of Wonder Woman's legs had to do with it being first? Not saying it can't be a hit but it could be a $200M+ difference at the BO. 
Popov, Sergi, the Rabbit from Red Rabbit, there's plenty of good Russians in the TC books. 

I think the only character group with little to no redeeming characteristics was druggies. You could tell he hated druggies. 
Black Widow would be there first if they were rushing a female movie out. 

My post was about dispelling the DC vs. Marvel myth, not supporting it. 

You were arguing Marvel doesn't trust their audience to support a Black Widow movie (I assume on the basis she's a female characters). I don't think that's a good assessment of why they haven't made one and supported it with an alternate theory as to why they haven't
Who doesn't hate the druggies. 
If you're anti-marijuana in anyway on Reddit, you'll be downvoted to hell.
