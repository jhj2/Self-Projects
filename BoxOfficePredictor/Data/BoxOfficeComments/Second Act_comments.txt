Itâ€™s absolutely ridiculous that Jennifer Lopez turns 49 in 5 days and is still this gorgeous... My god 
Save the cheerleader, save the world.
This looks pretty entertaining. Lopez doesn't age - she looks incredible. I am worried this will be a cookie-cutter plot, though. My guess is Vanessa will find out J-Lo's past is a lie and J-Lo will be gone. There will be outcry from the people who's lives she has enriched and Treat Williams will need to hire her back on because he was wrong: it's not about what school you went to or where you grew up, blah blah blah. Vanessa will see the error of her ways and her cold heart will thaw and stuff...

In any case, I think this will be a good time. Lopez is a great comedic actress!
Is it weird that I find this oddly refreshing from a box office filled with the Rock and superheroes?

A nice fun, 90 minute or so lighthearted comedy you could enjoy in a date night. 
I have just watched this at the movies and you are spot on!
