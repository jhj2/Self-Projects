Damn, Josh Brolin is the new hot shit right now. 

I almost throught he will drown, after the "Old Boy" fiasco.

Glad it didn't happen. 
I don't recall the trailers for the first movie, but this seems far more action oriented than Sicario was.
Not gonna watch this in order to avoid spoilers, but I'm hoping this is good. The writer (who wrote the original), has done nothing but stellar work (Wind River and Hell or High Water). So hopefully he can deliver a killer sequel.

It's insane how people can't understand marketing and just bitch about trailers all the time. Literally look back to Blade Runner 2049. I can remember Youtube comment sections and some redditors complaining how that movies trailers "look like a generic action movie. This isn't BLADE RUNNER". And that movie turned out to be even more "deliberately paced" than the original Blade Runner and was phenomenal. Now, with Sicario 2, people are doing the same exact, thing complaining about how this movie looks like a generic action movie and nothing like the first Sicario. GUYS, it's all marketing. This ain't the movie. If you pay close enough attention, they are showing the same 2 or 3 action set pieces, JUST LIKE THE TRAILERS for Blade Runner 2049. You cut the scenes in a way with fast music and it'll make it look like an action fuckathon... But I can guarantee you it won't be that. Word from early screenings is good so I'm confident. Seeing all this pessimism is cancerous
Looks a lot more focused on action than the previous one. Cinematography looks cool though
So hyped for this movie!
I liked first one and I don't mind it going into "generic action" direction and I liked every part of this trailer and didn't find anything cringy 

You can downvote me now /r/movie snobs
To those saying they have ruined Sicario take into account this trailer for Sicario

https://youtu.be/5PwwJ-18Y9g 

While there is no doubt that this is more action oriented the above trailer has a similar "pop trailer" vibe to it

I for one, have faith in Sheridan to deliver something that upends expectations
Tone in this trailer is like cheap B action movie, not what I would hope to see from sequel of Sicarion :/

And so much cheese in lines spoken, jesus

Hoping it's just edited that way.
I'm in.
That Josh Brolin is so hot right now
This looks terribly generic.
Yeesh, I miss the subtlety of the first one. I feel like I just watched an Expendables trailer. 

That title really needs some work too...
this looks pretty brutal.

I don't think it will match the quality of the first...but i am quite optimistic about this one. Same writer of the first so yeah..bring it on :D
The editing of this trailer completely changes the tone from the first couple of trailers.  Sure hope its closer in tone to the earlier trailers.
I see they’re pushing Brolin front and center now.. lol I wonder why! 
Why would anyone pull the trigger by sticking in the finger of your other hand and just rocking it back and forth? 
First movie was really good, but I feel like rewatching Emily Blunt's arc would be boring the second time. So I probably won't ever see it again
Looks good. I liked the first and this seems like a worthy sequel. Sollima will at the very least bring some top class vistas and cinematography
[I'd say one or two action sets similar to Sciario and Taylor's other movies like Wind River. My guess is Benecio Del Toro takes in the kid as his own and goes up against his handler Josh Brolin.](#spoiler)
I already know I'm gonna love the fuck out of this movie.

Brutal, violent, and morally ambiguous action is my poison.
So they're going for a completely different tone that made the first one great? Or is this just some new director acting like he knows what he's doing
I don't get it, why did sicario need a sequel?
So hyped for this.I know some people are doubting since villeneuve isn’t directing, but I have faith in sheridan.
Does Steve get shot at [about 0:50](https://youtu.be/4Wn5eSHbpio?t=49s)? 

I kinda hope he doesn't die (or at least not in such an unceremonial way). 
Compared to the other trailers, this was terrible. Still have high hopes for the movie. 
I'm in the minority in that I didn't like the first movie, like at all. I hope this one is better.
Just gonna be jingoistic nonsense
I predict about a 40% on RT
Hot take here, this looks like garage. 
This looks like trash compared to the first. 

This is what happens when you change leadership and directorship from one film to another to milk a semi lucrative cash cow.

Denis Villeneuve (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049) to unknown director.
Looks like Sicario learnt something from The Purge and John Wick...
[deleted]
Honestly I'm going to have a hard time sympathizing with Benicio Del Toro's character after seeing him murder a woman and her 2 kids in the last movie. We like him in Sicario because he's this quiet badass out for vengence, killing the bad guys and to hell with the rules. That is right up until he kills that family, and then straight up threatens to kill Emily Blunt. I just don't know how you base a movie around this character.
Trailer made the movie look like total schlock, especially the music. (will still watch though) 
From the trailers it seems like Brolin and del Toro will be trying to kill one another based off the trailers 
The trailers and everything marketing for this movie looks like trash. But I trust the people involved... I'd still prefer Villeneuve but I'm ok with the replacement they came up with. Idk how to feel, I'll have to sit and anxiously wait for the reviews.
Looks like they took the style of the action parts of the first movie and made a sequel out of it. Some of thoses scenes were great , others were lame, with cringe-worthy tough-guy talk and the basic premise that the most brutal drug war is „fuckin‘ awesome dude“, as long as you‘re on the Murican side.

This looks like two hours of the latter... 
I'm so glad, I've paid extra attention to whatever he's doing since seeing him in No Country for Old Men.
[deleted]
Luckily he dodged that *Old Boy* fiasco because no one ended up seeing that damn thing. It was so poorly marketed and like only Spike Lee took a hit from the debacle.
Inherent vice he’s great. One of my favourite actors.
He was fantastic in Only the Brave too which moved big time in October last year. Was a case of unfortunate timing because of real life wild fires blazing across the states so I felt it was kinda swept under the rug, coupled with public apathy on the topic led to low returns. Great film though.
Also nice use of hyper generic, american rap soundtrack in movie that is called "Sicario bla bla Soldado".

Facepalm.
I honestly think that's just the marketing... I do think this will have MORE action than Sicario 1... but if you really pay attention it's highlighting the same 2 or 3 action scenes in all the trailers
after the story of Sicario, it makes sense. This is war now.
TBH, all the action scenes were probably used for the trailer.

gets butts in seats.
Which is a good continuation to the end of the first one.

"This is the land of wolves now."
That jumped out to me too. I'm not sure if it is actually reflective of a change from Sicario or if this is just how they thought best to market it to get people in the theater.
That is the point. The writers said that this will be more action focused.
The first movie was dumb as shit and mainly focused on the naive FBI agent taking umbrage at being sheep dip for a CIA operation.
Yeah, the rap song in the background feels like it's going against the whole tone of the first.
It's great that Wind River has been on Netflix, I've spread the word at work about it and everyone who has watched it has been floored. Really wish Hell or High Water was on netflix at some point, I feel it's just as good as Wind River and close to Sicario's quality. 


Sheridan has a new series based around Yellowstone which looks to have a nice western vibe.  Only catch is it's on the paramount network, which I didn't even know was a thing. 
Same here, I refuse to watch the trailers (even stood in the hallway at the theater to avoid them) for any movie and I'm especially staying away from trailers for this movie like I did with Blade Runner 2049. Sicario was amazing and I can't have trailers telling me *anything* that I'm going to see on the big screen.
No Denis though :(
This trailer doesn’t give away that much. The other ones do. 
Wind River is an incredible film that not a lot of people know about. It's also a film that leaves you feeling somewhat empty and defeated.
>no es personal 

Para mi sí. 
Nothing personnel, kid.
NO. TRAILERS SHOULD BE A BLACK SCREEN WITH AUDIO OF THE DIRECTOR READING A SINGLE LINE ABOUT WHAT THE PLOT IS. 
I remember everyone complaining that the scene with Gosling running with the hole in the wall behind him gave away he was a replicant -- then in the first five minutes you're told he's a replicant.

Not everything is a spoiler. People are fucking crazy uptight.
Blade Runner 2049's trailers were bad though. Like really bad. Unless you were a hardcore fan and knew who Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins were, I wouldn't blame people for dismissing it as a generic sci\-fi action movie. I watched 2049 because I knew the pedigree of the people involved. If some no\-name people were involved, I'd have skipped it based on the poor trailers. And the sad part is that even though it was marketed as an action movie, it **still** flopped. 
It's just edited that way.
The way I see it, this movie is to Sicario, what Aliens was to Alien. 
I'm confident this movie will do good. 
Gotta appeal to that Friday night crowd.  Those mofos love generic.
don’t most films look terribly generic?
I remember that's what everyone said about the first Sicario trailer. 
You guys gotta really keep in mind this is a 1 minute 20 second trailer... I know it says "Official Trailer" but it is not. It's not a trailer that would be shown in theaters. This is more of an extended TV Spot so that's why they are presenting it as a big action movie but I can all but guarantee you that it is not that. It'll have more action than Sicario 1 but it will still have the same methodical and deliberate feel as the original... The reactions we have heard from the test screenings were really positive so I'm excited 
This is what a cash grab really looks like. The irony is r/movies is bonering big time for it.

This thing simply stole characters and aesthetics from the first film and turned it into Rambo 2.
an earlier trailer seemed to go that way with the story
I expected the reaction on here to be about the (almost) complete removal of the kid from this trailer when the previous trailer made that look like the main conflict.  Oh well.
The reactions from test screenings were highly positive so nah
I predict around -40 downvotes on Reddit.
> ...this looks like garage.

I disagree. I think it looks more like car port. 
Denis was at one point an unknown director as well.
This unknown director created Gommorah, one of the best crime tv series afaik.
I won't even give it a chance if the reviews suck. Absolutely loathe it when studios cash in on earned goodwill, making a shit movie that is more of a butts-in-seats math equation than an attempt of actually doing justice to the IP. 

I'm holding out hope, but trailers like this aren't exactly reassuring. 
I assumed he was making the sequel. Very sad he isn't. 


If you haven't, watch the special features for Blade Runner 2049. I just watched them yesterday and was blown away at how awesome the short films and "making of" features are. (I assumed you were a fan and owned Blade Runner, if not; sorry)
From the last trailer, this may be his attempt at some form of redemption.

Also, given his losses, you can't act like his actions occurred in a vacuum. They weren't just some random family, minding their own legal, non-murderous, victimless  business. 
I don't want to sympathise with his character but this sequel will try to make me nonetheless 

Instant fail right there

I doubt this will not suck

He was completely off my radar until *No Country for Old Men*. I’ve made a point to see all the Josh Brolin I can since then. Dude’s great.
Only time I’ve been really disappointed with a movie of his was Jonah Hex
I’ve been following him since he played the treasure hunter in Into the Blue!
He was in the remake an amazingly good Korean movie ("Old Boy"), and apparently it wasn't so good.

Korean original: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/reference

Remake: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1321511/

Also the actors weren’t the cringypart. I thought both he and Olson did their best with what they had. 
The marketing for Sicario 1 also used rap music soooo
British* 
I was thinking that too. They cut back to what looks like the same highway scene multiple times. And really, that's about how many action scenes the first one had. They look a bit larger in scale but I don't think it's going to take over the whole film.
Exactly. I feel like it's the logical next step.
The first Sicario movie had a small trailer like this too with rap music playing over it so no need to worry about that
apparently its just a renamed spike tv
[deleted]
I already saw some trailers for this and they reveal way too much.
Good problem to have though. Dude's been killing it so well that even  though his big budgeted sci fi film didn't exactly do well at the box office, they're still trusting him with an even more ambitious sci fi outing.
Sheridan says he wants there to be a trilogy, and Denis has said he really wants to finish it and direct the 3rd one...read that somewhere like a month ago.
ai caramba 
[deleted]
Bladerunner first trailer was amazing with a dystopian theme, but the quality detoriated after second and third 
Also, like a comment above said. After the first one, this is war. Sicario set up the tension, this one releases it all over the audience.  
Lets hope so, and hope it doesn't go Prometheus on us. 
The first Sicario didn't.
[No, they didn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3aas9k/sicario_official_trailer_1_starring_emily_blunt/). 
As I've said before: As far as I know, Soldado is produced by two US indie studios, Black Label Media and Thunder Road Picture, and the italian Rai Cinema. It's not being produced by one of the Hollywood major film studios or their subsidiaries, so I doubt it's a brainless, edgy action film. Also because it just doesn't fit their style, both the writer and the director. Sheridan wrote three raw and realistic stories, and Sollima knows what he's doing: Gomorrah is one of the most grounded and visceral crime tv shows in recent years. 
For a movie sub, people here are so ignorant. The writer of the first film (also wrote two other pretty good movies) is writing this one.
Yup, exactly. It should be a red flag that Villeneuve and Deakins are not returning. 
I originally though the plot was totally different until I watched the second trailer which is where I have this view from. Also Taylor's films have been very similar regarding having only one or two action pieces and being thematically thriller. 

To me though knowing the plot doesn't matter, the experience is what counts and how it's executed. Revenge is a good example, it's a movie that has the cliché rape and revenge but executes it really well. 
He directed a bunch of Gomorrah and worked closely with the production but he wasn't the creator. 

He also directed Suburra, which is really good. Anyone who's actually seen his work would know he's a good choice for this movie. 
Omfg, stop spreading this bullshit ignorance and dismissive hate. The writer wanted to make a sequel. And the writer (who wrote the first film) has a brilliant track record along with getting nominated for an Oscar.
i actually like him in Men in Black.  He took another actors character and put it on like a glove.  
Mucho pancako!!
have you watched only the brave? really good movie about the granite mountain hotshots and he played his role really well along with miles teller, taylor kitsch, jeff bridges, and james badge dale. 
I like Jonah Hex, yeah it could have been better, but it was an entertaining movie. 
Yeah, the spike Lee one was pure shit compared to the original (which is very good). The original was shocking and nuanced and had some crazy cool fight cinematography and cheteography while the American version just simplified and cut corners and just devalued the original in every way. 
Yeah, but the should have used some spanish rap just to fit the theme you know?
Even fucking worse.
Exactly. You nailed it
Ah, haven't had cable in a decade. :/
It’s still there! Thanks for reminding me that I want to rewatch it soon.
Ehh its hard to say. Its entirely possible that the apparent twists that were revealed happens in the prologue or by the end of the first act thus setting up the rest of the actual story..
Good to know. All I know is that Benicio Del Toro is reprising his role, which is good. I just hope the movie doesn't suck ass.
oh awesome if he did the 3rd that'd be sick.
Trailers are for people in movie theaters in a mall in Kansas who happen to look up at the screen before Deadpool 2 plays. They aren't for movie buffs, or redditors, or people who watch every new trailer and then dissect it in an internet forum. We are outliers. 

They are designed for the lowest common denominator. This is not "marketing" to you, because you are not the target audience. A general audience that thinks an action movie looks better than a complex violent thriller is the audience. 

Don't let trailers change your expectations about a movie. It's a preview, you get to see some footage. They are not artful representations of the exact tone of the movie. Watch the trailer for Sicario, it's much more action packed than the movie. 

Follow directors and writers that you like, skip the trailers if it ruins it for you, and form your own opinion. 
That's fair enough... Personally for me the trailers get me very excited but that might be due to the fact that I am extremely confident in the movie being good... It's too bad that the trailers aren't doing it for you and that's fine but I really do believe the movie will be pretty solid
I created the sound fx for this film, I've seen it literally hundreds of times. The trailer just shows a collection of shots, there's no correlation to the story.
[deleted]
The trailers did. 
I disagree, Sicario was very generic. Very uninteresting and dull
Meh. That wasn't the one they were running on the 30sec TV commercials. 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5PwwJ-18Y9g

To be fair, Basil Iwanyk ( Thunder Road) produces the John Wick franchise. As well as the new Robin Hood flick, Gods of Egypt, and the rebooted Clash of the Titans films. Indie does not mean quality. He's done some objectively high quality films as well.

Black Label (billionaire Molly Smith) just released 12 Strong.

Taking a film's worth based on the producers is a total toss up. Same for writers.

I'm hoping this film is the exact opposite of what it looks like. But historically speaking, it's not highly likely. Leveraging the first film to make a second is a pretty basic business strategy. I hope it is just marketing, but man does it look like a balls to the wall shoot em up movie with a very thin plot, lots of action, recycled characters, and little no thematic resonance (certainly as compared to the first).
Ignorant might be not knowing that a ton of great writers have written a ton of terrible films. Or that Sheridan was also super busy off making (writing, directing, doing PR, pitching, developing, casting, prepping) his own film and tv series, not standing over the director’s shoulder telling him how to make Scicario 2. 

But I’m not here to call people ignorant. Only to voice my disappointment at what this appears to be, an advantageous sequel that has evolved from a tense and dramatic theme driven sense of dread an moral quandary in the first film, to an aesthetic copy full of action. 

I will be super happy to be wrong. 
How is that a red flag? The writer is returning.
[Apprently Denis wanted to Soldado, but was already busy with Blade Runner. He may come back for Sicario 3.](https://screenrant.com/sicario-3-denis-villeneuve-director/)
It shouldn't have to be. But expectations should definitely be adjusted. The most disappointing thing will be if it really is just a mindless action flick with cool setting and visuals. As opposed to a film with impactful themes and drama that sticks with you long after it's over, which is exactly what Villeneuve did with the first one (it's kind of his specialty). The "action" and visuals are there to serve that stuff, not replace it.
>**I’m holding out hope**, but trailers like this aren’t exactly reassuring. 
He definitely is a young Tommy Lee Jones. Same demeanor and acting. Both of them are great actors. 
I see what you did there.
He completely missed the point.  Oldboy was at it's heart about a lover taking revenge for his loss.  Spike Lee just saw it for the shock value and decided to turn that up to 11 and skip the nuance.  [Brother secretly in love with his sister?  Better make it the dad fucking his kids!](#s) 
The theme of the American government interfering with (broadly)Mexican affairs? Seems like it had the intended effect on you. 
[deleted]
Sorry, wasnt trying to disagree with you. Was actually agreeing while also giving a theory why it may have more action than the previous film. 

Pretty awesome you did the sound fx for this film though! Does it hold up to the First? 
Yeah, to me this trailer looks like more of Josh Brolin and the CIA Bro's. The dialogue from them, seems to be the same tone as when they were in their scenes in Sicario. Me personally (I know you didn't ask) I am not to worried. 
Well you've inspired me to re-watch them. 

[Exhibit A: Sicario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR0SDT2GeFg)

[Exhibit B: Day of the Soldado](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wn5eSHbpio&feature=youtu.be)

I think there's a pretty big difference. Sicario's trailer at least makes an attempt at mirroring the movie's dark, tense, brooding tone. Day of the Soldado carries much more of a "shoot first, reveal plot points later" flavor. Very reminiscent of F&F movies and other generic action affairs—complete with quips and hip hop music that imply a complete tonal-shift from the first movie.

I'm not saying Day of the Soldado will necessarily be like the trailer, but after viewing both I think the differences should be fairly obvious. 
Finish your meal.
So you're moving the goalposts instead of admitting you were wrong? Cool. Cool cool cool.
It's definitely more action oriented than the first one, but that's okay.  The fact that it's an action film doesn't mean it will be a bombastic, over the top, Fast & Furious type of film. We've seen the first one, now it's time to explore new territories.

Sicario grossed $84 million worldwide with a budget of $30 million. It doesn't seem like they're exploiting the success of the first film. Don't forget that Sicario was never meant to be a standalone film: Sheridan has always shared the idea of an 'anthology' trilogy.
But this seems like a terrible film because it seems like an action film? Sheridan himself has said that this will be an action film. You don't think he was busy writing this film too?

This is like bitching that Evil Dead 2 sucks because Evil Dead was a horror film while that sequel was a comedy. 
You could take it as a slight like the two didn't think it would be worth returning for and didn't want to take a step down and do the sequel.

Although you could just as easily say that both of them are rather popular right now and are too busy with other projects.
You guys gotta keep in mind this is just marketing... Literally look back a couple of months to Blade Runner 2049. I dont remember reddit, but the Youtube comments on the trailers were filled with "OH this looks like a generic action movie. Looks nothing like a Blade Runner movie. Hollywood is out of ideas" and stupid shit like that and then the movie came out and was the farthest thing from an action movie and was honestly more "deliberately paced" than the original... 
Yeah, I was such a fan of the original, when I went and saw the spike Lee version I was so disappointed
Were those last two sentences meant to be hyperlinks? 
Most people like seeing trailers and it's not a negative for them. That's not the case for you, and that's fine, but you don't have to click on anything that is upvoted. 

If you want to see what movies are coming out with no trailers, just look at [a detailed schedule.](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/schedule/) Then you can do a little research about the plot synopsis, who made it, etc. Seems like the cleanest way to do it if you're really into seeing movies, but not super plugged in on what is coming out. 
Oh yeah, I gotcha, it's cool. Seems we're of the same mind ... NICE!!!

Yeah I did the first one as well. "Soldado", as we were calling it, is FREAKIN' AWESOME!!! I love it, and I hope you will too.
Ok that's not fair... for Sicario 1 you sent in the actual official trailer that would be played in theaters... This "trailer" for the sequel is more of an extended TV Spot
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5PwwJ-18Y9g

Check this out
lmao what. Nah
Shows up as a spoiler tag on mobile ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
[deleted]
Did you know Jóhann Jóhannsson? 
ha, you're absolutely right. [Here's one for the first movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PwwJ-18Y9g) that's everything I mentioned about the trailer above.

Though I think Soldado's [official theatrical trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIMChzE_aCo) falls short of Sicario's—just not as much as before.
I saw the sicario 2 trailer before "A Quiet Place" in theatres and I thought it looked awful. 
I used to professionally make trailers at a major movie studio. 

Trailers are pretty rigorously tested by focus groups. They test initial cuts against each other, final cuts to see where to run them, etc. The people they test these movies for are random people in malls who are free on weekdays, not movie fans. And looking at the box office from last year, and from 20 years ago, in the late 90s, 5-10 of the top 50 movies at the box office were dramatic thrillers. Last here, depending on how you classify horror thrillers like Get Out and Split, I'd argue zero of the top 50 movies are thrillers. 

It's not that they are trying to convey "action movie," like John Wick or something. They are trying to convey "big event that you have to go to the theater for." Showing some tense conversation isn't going to do that. 
No I did not, he was in the music department, I'm in the sound department. The Music Editor was the person we dealt with during the mix of the film.
It's because the latter is an action film. The writer (who wrote both films) said that Sicario was supposed to be a slow burn and Soldado a fast paced action film.
It's gonna be good... The reactions from the early screenings were good
[deleted]
Ah ok. 
It only looks "terribly generic" because the "generic" here has been established by the existence of a Sicario.
Oh I'm not saying that it's not going to. I'm just saying that the theatrical trailer also looked very bad. Was not intrigued. I have movie pass so I'll see it anyway but it's not a movie I'm really looking forward to. 
Don't sweat, this was literally my job, I have to know all this. I do agree the definition of "action movie" has really changed to "blockbuster." There are barely any straight action movies anymore.

It's super possible this movie will suck. But not sure if you saw it, the original [teaser trailer for Sicario 2](https://youtu.be/Pymm6cmE9uQ) has a much closer tone of the original film, tells you almost nothing about the story, and has a much more subdued feel to it. Maybe you should just only watch the very first teaser trailers. The later in the promo cycle a trailer is, the more it will show and the more general audience aimed it will be. 
I think it looks generic because the trailer is incredibly generic of typical action movies. But like the guy posted above, Sicario had a similarly uninspired TV spot so should only be taken with a grain of salt.
I thought it looked pretty good when I saw it, I'm sure I'll check it out. Different than the first movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since it kind of needs to be without Emily Blunt driving it.    
    
A little more action-oriented is what was set up at the end of the first film anyway.
