This almost looks like a parody. I'm sure it'll be fun with a drink or two in hand.
He's running so incredibly slow in the last scene. I will never believe he makes that jump
Between A Rock And A Die Hard Place.
You just know there's gonna be a scene where the rock whacks a guy over the head with his prosthetic leg.
This looks like one of those fake trailers that would play before Tropic Thunder.
I have a feeling that Rock is accepting every script coming his way.               
**AIM FOR THE BUSHESSSSSSSS**
I bet there's a scene where his prosthetic leg gets detached and then he beats someone unconscious with it.
This is a couple of movies that I feel I have seen before.
It's a film about FAMILY
Die Hard with kids.
When he jumped, Foo Fighters' "My Hero" just popped in my head
I hate to say it, but I’m feeling the Rock fatigue kicking in :/
Neve Campbell was a surprise
I feel like the Rock is only doing this movie to establish himself in the Chinese market.
This would be a perfect 80's-type action movie if it didn't take itself so seriously. This is a problem with many Dwayne Johnson action movies, he plays it completely straight when it should at least be a bit tongue in cheek given the ridiculous concept. 
So we're back at Russians being the bad guys again?
When I saw this during the super bowl I thought this was a Tide commercial.
More like 'Glassbreaker' featuring Rock
HOLY SHIT THE ROCK IS GOING TO FIGHT A SKYSCRAPER
Die Rock Hard! 
The second time it showed smith popping on his fake leg I thought for sure it was fake.

When smith was hanging by his fake leg at the end of the trailer I knew it's GOTTA be fake.

Turns out its real

Edit : in less than 24 hours from seeing the ad I have confused the movie for starring will Smith and not the rock. I'm bad. That is all. 
Die Hard on the Towering Inferno.
This movie looks so stupid lol it looks like a movie from the beginning of tropic thunder 
This movie is gonna flop hard. I have heard a lot about rock being a box office draw, but most of his successful movies are either part of already successful franchises, sequels or have huge cast. From its trailer, I don't see this movie doing well, unless it's a really good movie. 
Cinematographer on this one is Robert Elswit, who has shot many PTA films (winning the Oscar for There Will Be Blood) and also did a great job on Nightcrawler.

If anything, I might see the movie for him.

Then again, this movie doesn’t look so good.
Lemme guess, The Rock attempts to catch a guy, fails, gets his leg amputated, gets job as security assessor. Guy comes back with mercs, surround the building and shenanigans ensue
Die Hard
Die Hard made for the Chinese market
I have a bittersweet feeling towards the Rock that I've been vocal about in other threads. I think he has good intentions and honestly wants to deliver entertaining/inspirational movies that *also* make a lot of money, because the two aren't mutually exclusive.

I just wish he took acting a bit more seriously, hired a coach and focused on nuance. Whenever there's a close-up of him, I can practically hear the director saying "This is the part where you look [insert emotion here]."

Dwayne's a way better performer than he is an actor, but he could be both if he invested even half the time in the artistry of acting as he does in lifting weights.
The gunner on that helicopter can't aim for shit but whoever's controlling that spotlight is on point. Maybe they should have swapped jobs?
Dwayne Johnson as Bruce Willis as John McClane in Die Hard: The Remake
so he has prosthetic legs only for that one plot point right?
Yeah, this movie doesn't look good, but it's cool to see Neve Campbell getting some work again!
This is basically a cheap knock off of The Towering Inferno...
Dwayne McLane Jhonson in Die Hard:On One Foot
That’s a tall building
Fake News Die Hard
This looks Promising. I really liked San Andreas a lot Hopefully this Movie will be as good or even better then San Andreas
Handicap Die Hard.... 
Die Hard with a missing leg
I will see this movie. That is all.
I honestly thought this trailer was Rampage, but focusing only on the DJ rather than the monsters.
Another film that's obviously just money laundering. 
It’s like die hard in a skyscra...oh wait.
It's like Stupid Die Hard.
I know the Rock is trying to make "that bacon" (to take a line from the trailer), but I think he has more than enough bacon to last 10 lifetimes between his movies and WWF/WWE days.

I'd like him to be more choosier with the scripts. Take the Rock out of this and this movie is just another film closer to Sharknado levels of corn. I know the Rock can afford to do much better movies than this. 
Does this movie only get a pass because its the Rock?  Anyone else and we'd all be rolling our eyes.  I love Dwayne Johnson but this still looks really stupid.
Finally! The Rock has been cast in a Die Hard movie!
I don't know why but I was hoping for more from this...
*Die Hard... in a building!*
do they even hire cinematographers anymore? 
So, this is like Die (Rock) Hard?
Towering Inferno + Die Hard =

I'm more excited about this movie than about Solo. Great trailer, for what looks like a great throwback to the action movies of the '80s and '90s.
Is this a remake of that Anna Nicole Smith softcore porno or an original story?
Its not gonna win any awards but it looks like a fun, turn your brain off, action movie. I'll watch it
Very die hard in this.
This looks like it might be ok, a decent watch. The only thing stopping me waiting to see this on Redbox is Dwayne. I'll go see anything dude is in after Jumanji 2.
I really thought this was going to be a Die Hard reboot while watching the preview, I mean the Rock even has a shaved head like Bruce Willis did. Big new building, terrorists or whatever, fire on the upper floors...
I've heard so many stories of this production being a nightmare to work on.
So Die Hard mixed with The Towering Inferno. But probably not ss good as either of them. 
is this based on a true story?
It's like Die Hard, Towering Inferno, and 9/11 all rapt-up into one. 
Question for the Americans, is it normal for the FBI to operate like a special forces unit? That scene at the beginning when they're breaching that house and they look all military, then he says 'we're the FBI' or something made me laugh because it just seemed so ridiculous.
I mean I love stupid blockbusters and San Andreas was actually pretty good. But this, this looks like a hot pile of bullshit that thinks it's gonna be High Rise without the class commentary...
Honestly this looks super boring
Like... I'll see this in Theaters, but this looks worse than Rampage... Which I will also be seeing in theaters. I love The Rock. 
This is Paul Blart Mall Cop.

But with the Rock.

GIVE ME A HELL YEAH.
Is... is this a trailer for a die hard remake?
Dwayne johnson every darn trailer give liam neeson lol
I'll be there opening weekend even though I'll admit that he has no chance of making that jump at the end.
When the ad showed up during the game I thought it was a joke ad.  Guess not.
We say that now, but then watch it make $885 million.
It looks like an Asylum-version of Die Hard...
peg leg Die-hard

peg hard


I got the same feeling.
It looked like one of the parody "trailers" at the beginning of Tropic Thunder
My guess is that he'll be a foot short.
It's cool. There's some bushes under him. . 
Coming off from the Mission Impossible trailer, all I was thinking was that Tom Cruise would've done the stunt irl for the sake of being Tom Cruise. 
The Rock has weird hang time.  He will easily make that jump.  Evidence https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_lijqXNZ4o&feature=youtu.be&t=3m24s
The building is over 500 stories tall. Not sure what floor he'll crash into but he's gotta hit it at some point.
I dunno if that's to simulate someone with a prosthetic leg or something, or he's just gotten super buff/chunky and can't run anymore.

Either way it looks fucking hilarious.
Nah man you see his prosthetic leg actually has a rocket booster attached to it, like Iron Man. All of the tickets please!
But he didn't make the jump. He end up hanging off his artificial leg
He makes it. The twist is he swapped his prosthetic leg out for his kids pogo stick
The Rock makes the jump. Period.
kevin hart is out of the shot but he's gonna use him as a hang glider 
Aim for the bushes!
"It's like Die Hard... but in a skyscraper! With terrorists!"
Now that would be a great buddy cop movie. Willis and Johnson
Underrated comment right here.  
The Artifacts ! Solid classic. 
Only one? I'm hoping the entire movie is just the Rock hopping around on one leg beating up bad guys with the other. 
This comment looks like one of those comments I've seen in another thread.

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7usq36/skyscraper_official_poster_dwayne_johnson/dtmz6m1/
He's gonna be the new Samuel L Jackson
I'm guessing that he normally gets offered the amount of money that is hard to say no to. 
You bet your ass. He is almost like an actor except most actors might consider their legacy, the difficulty of the part, the importance of the role.

The rock will take any work you give him as long as the check is signed and dated right.
C R U I S E L I N E R
If that's the case, I'm making a spec script for a movie where Rock teams up with Mick Foley (not Mankind) for one last adventure.
#HardestWorkerInTheRoom
**T H E R E   G O E S   M Y   H E R O**
The Rock is hanging off the edge of the building with the bad guy hanging off the Rock's leg. The Rock detaches his prosthetic, causing the bad guy to fall Hans Gruber style. Insert cheesy one-liner. 
He'll be holding it it like a baseball bat and say, "I'm going to kick your ass!" before bashing the dude's head in.
It's pronounced "FAH-MUH-LEE"
They're really aiming for the bushes from up there.
I think the problem is that all of his characters feel identical. Even Arnold had more variety to his characters during his heyday. I love The Rock, but everyone he plays is just "The Rock" in different clothes.
It's pretty ironic that I feel like his whole 'work hard, 100%' thing is why he's popular, but also churning out these movies nonstop will make the fatigue kick in quicker. 
I've been feeling it for 2 years.
So am I, as I'm sure plenty of other ppl on this sub are. However, all of my aunts, older sister's, all of their kids and hell, even my mom. LOVE the rock and will go see ANY movie he's in. I like him well enough, but his target audience isn't us. 
The problem is that I think most of his movies are just "that was ok I guess", I thought Baywatch and San Andreas was awful. Like really really bad.

I've seen 28 movies of his, and he hasn't been in a movie I consider GOOD since The Other Guys where he has a very small part. (Now I haven't seen Jumanji yet)-

When doing nothing but mediocre stuff at best it is easy to get kinda tired.
I loved him in the last movie he was in (as did most people), that being Jumanji. So I think it's okay for now. Obviously not speaking for you, just generally. He comes in 2-3 movies every year, which is solid, and rarely is he ever the only star in the movie. He almost always has *big* A-list co-stars.

As long as his movies are entertaining, he will remain popular and his movies enjoyable. Baywatch is the only film of his in recent memory that was unenjoyable. 
Boo
I just don't normally watch the type of movies that he is in, so I'm not sick of him yet honestly. 
nope, i still like him. but in ensemble movies
You say that, and maybe I say that, but he gets on screen and says one joke or smiles, and i am on board, just like how I never get tired of Tom Cruise... I will still probably watch this...
I don't think a lot of 80s action movies were all that tongue in cheek though, they might have had some dumb one-liners, but they were mostly played straight. And even then I think the amount of cheesy-one liners are greatly overestimated, like I think people are misremembering things here.  
But the "80s action movies" you're talking about are played straight. The tongue in cheek irony is a recent thing.
I don't know if you're joking or being ironic, but Dwayne Johnson is the definition of tongue in cheek 
The reason 80's action movies worked so well is because it was giant buff half-actors playing it completely straight. 
Dwayne Johnson litteraly said in this trailer he's gonna earn his paycheck! How is that not tongue in cheek?
or if the fx budget was lower. It doesn't feel as exciting if it looks computer generated 
Da.
Need the asian market
well thats the loser side's narrative right?

I'm okay with it, russians make good villains. especially when they're played by Brits
I thought it was a Rampage trailer and was incredibly excited, then I thought it was a Die Hard remake/reboot and had mixed feelings, then I saw it's called Skyscraper and tempered my expectations to a minimum.
THAT'S AUSTIN'S MUSIC
One word: China
it could make money overseas, dumb blockbusters often work here + The Rock.
San Andreas, which appears to be a fairly similar film and has no franchise connections made $474 million worldwide.
What? How does that happen? Hey Oscar guy you want to shoot a schlocky January action movie?
I mean that is exactly what the trailer showed us, so its not much of a guess
They already did that with die hard 5.
The FBI has the Hostage Rescue Team and some supporting SWAT units that are generally considered one of the best counter  terror units in the world, similar to GSG-9 or GIGN in Germany and France, respectively.
I love The Rock too, so let's keep him focused on being in pretty good movies by not paying to see him in total garbage. 
His shirt looked pretty clean...
Same here, kept waiting for the other shoe to drop (huehuehue) that it was a parody or for David Harbour to show up with a "Tide ad".
Asylum?
Is there any other way to peg? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Booo
Really need a leg up to make a jump like that. 
But is he aiming for them?
THERE GOES MY HEEEEERO
Tom Cruise did do the jump in the trailer, and broke his ankle.
It's like he was swimming through air
Was he punching bricks lmao
thats fast and furious physics
I dont remember the equations needed but I am sure he will follow the parabolic curve in his fall, meaning after certain distance he will smash his leg on a pavement downstairs.
>  simulate someone with a prosthetic leg

I think that's what they're going for.  He definitely didn't look this goofy running in Baywatch.
" It's like Die Hard 2 except it's in a skyscraper not an airport!"
Lmao, so you mean its Die Hard, but in Die Hard, with Die Hard!  ... I actually ran over to my uncle who is a huge fan of Die Hard, and said hey look its Dwayne Johnson playing a new Die Hard reboot... and my uncle was like " Oh, that looks pretty good!'
It's like Die Hard, but it's Die Hard in China.
I mean... I'd still pay money to watch that.
A one legged man in an ass kicking competition. 
Never go full repost. 
Say Rock again! I dare you I double dare you madafuka. Say Rock one more goddamn time

He's bold!
Go on.
He's black!

That's because he wants to rule the market.  Actors do that to stop the rise of a rival, so they accept it all. 
He prefers briefcases full of unmarked $100 bills. 
i fucking loved that movie
"I guess now you have to... leg it."
"That's what you get for pulling my leg!"

"I'll have what she's having"
"Fall a mile... with my shoe"
If that's not in the movie, they fucked up.
remindme! 6 months
[It's been done.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFyCQlbO7VA&t=25)
I thought it was “fambly”
That's why his role in *Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle* was so refreshing as he basically played a young, anxious nerd.
And Arnold's movies were way better. Sorry Rock.

These Rock movies lately (with the exception of Jumanji) feel like the type of movies Arnold did *after* he finished his duties as Governor - where the roles were drying up and he just had to take what was left. I'd like to see the Rock have a few action classics under his belt the way Arnold did.
I think it also has to do with that fact that he has a tendency to over-hype every movie he's in. Just look at his Instagram post for Skyscraper. I'm all for dumb action movies but there's no need to hype it like it's the Citizen Kane of action. 
That's a great point. Most of his characters seem an extension of him in the last movie. He's not a great actor. Doesn't mean you can't be successful however.
Dad trying to win the affection of his family by performing super human stunts and stopping criminal enterprises or natural disasters.  
I think the problem is that he simply isn't dynamic enough of an actor, and that he plays in the same type of movies, they're almost all either action movies, or action-comedies. 
Yeah he is just a movie star who is half decent at acting, not an actor. Guy needs to slow down 
Careful or he'll scream at you on Twitter.
I've been feeling it since 1966 now
I never felt it. He will always just be a professional wrestler to me. Never paid attention to any of his films. 
wow you're so cool
I'm kinda curious why you've watched 28 of his movies if you never end up liking them.
San Andreas was nowhere near as bad as Baywatch.
I thought San Andreas was fun. It wasn't good, but it was a good time.
[deleted]
Yep. This movie looks like great fun precisely because it's not a tongue-in-cheek parody.
[deleted]
lol true
I want bad Chinese with Jackie chan as villain but then turns into good guy after being betrayed by jet li
BAI GAWD
Lemme guess, The Rock is a former FBI agent who loses his leg in a mission gone wrong. He leaves the FBI and then studies 6 months to prepare for a job as head of security in a high-tech super skyscraper, much to the chagrin of the owner's right hand man. Then terrorists raid the skyscraper and there's a fire on the 96th floor and The Rock has to find a way to get his family out safely, all while avoiding the terrorists and making epic leaps off of cranes. That's my guess.
Ahh, cool, I guess our version would be SO-19. Just always associated the FBI with the law enforcement side of things! 
Tide Ad.
Hopper was da real mvp of the game
A movie studio that releases awful, low-budget rip offs with similar names as blockbusters. Like when there is a King Arthur blockbuster they released King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Geostorm was a big budget action movie, they released Geo-Disaster. Other movies they released in 2017 is Operation Dunkirk and Alien Convergence, I think you can guess what movies they rip-off. It seems like their business model is making people pick up the wrong movie in the video store...

Their biggest hit is Sharknado though, which is an original!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum


urns!
the craziest for me is the superman in pineapple express. i meant to say funniest
Out of context it looks weird as shit but in the film he doesn't refuses to use guns and so in this scene he punches the pillars or whatever of bricks to bring down those guys shooting at him above him.
And he makes so many of them.. that when he has his first string of failures, he will still have 4-5 more in the can for full paydays that are gonna come out the years after. So the studios are just gonna have to suck it up on those movies.
The rock will only ever rule "popcorn" movies. I will eat my hat the day the rock wins an Academy award or Film Festival honors.
"I gave him the boot."
“Let go my leggo...”
"Check, please!"
Even in Central Intelligence he played an awkward nerd type character.
For sure. IMO, the closest The Rock has gotten to the classic action movies was The Rundown. It's the right mix of humor and ridiculous action. It has a charm that his current flicks seem to lack.
He's in the movie though. I doubt producers, studios, and his agent want him telling people his movies are "just okay, maybe wait till it comes out on DVD though."
>Actor is excited about movie he's in

"Yo fuck this guy, how dare he"


The amount of times he writes 'original concept film' across his posts makes it seem like he really doesn't want to believe it's Die Hard in China with a prosthetic. 
I mean, he knows his range.  He's obviously not going to be winning any Oscars and won't be able to do these types of films forever, might as well cash in while you can before you run for President.  
Dude just dragged Jumanji to 900million. I think he thinks he’s doing fine haha
Looks like a fun movie.  It's not going to be some crazy deep movie, but for every Blade Runner you'll get a Skyscraper.  There's nothing really wrong with that.  May not be your cup of tea but others clearly love the Rock explosion right now.

Also telling a movie star who's career is exploding to slow down, yeah right.
right?!?
I watch a lot of movies for a lot of reasons, sometimes "sort of enjoyable" is good enough for that moment. And only San Andreas and Baywatch was actually BAD. And I always watch all blockbusters, even ones that I don't think I am gonna enjoy, just so that I can have a constructive opinion on them, same reason I watch Mallick, Felleni, Tarkovsky and stuff as well. And every know and then one of them surprises me and I actually like them!

And I think The Rock is great when he is used right, I still think The Scorpion King is one of his best performances because they seemed to embrace the cheeky charm where he does his best work the best. He has evolved as an actor since but most of the time where he acts serious the scenes are overly dramatic and it just feels forced and meh to me.

And I like Doom, Southland Tales, The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King as previously mentioned. Looking forward to watching Jumanji when it is released on home video as well, not sure what I am gonna think about it but I am curious.

Movies is a hobby and interest of mine and it is bigger than "I enjoy watching good movies".
I agree. Baywatch was truly awful and the worst movie of 2017. San Andreas was just bad...
I didn't think the movie was very good.
The Rock was ok in it I guess. But the movie was pretty bad. It was sort of alright, but also pretty bad. Definitely not good.

And I didn't talk about The Rock being good or bad in anything really, just that it is rare to see him in a good movie. And no matter how good an actor is, if they are in a not so good movie it doesn't really matter much.
I very strongly disagree, I thought San Andreas took itself very very seriously at times.
No chance mate, I reckon you’re way off
There's probably just the one leap off a crane.
That's UK, correct? IDK if Special Officers has SWAT, but FBI HRT would probably fill the role SAS did in the Iranian Embassy Siege. The USA Armed Forces have a lot more prohibitions regarding domestic operations, so we have a militarized law enforcement element.
I was saying Boourns... 
No need for urns, he's not the Undertaker
But does he have some kind of super strength in the movie?
I try and temper my hatred but the rock is one of my least favorite celebrities because of how much he insists on forcing himself into the public eye.
"break a leg"
[deleted]
I meant that I’m tired of seeing him in every 5th movie. Also Jumanji is meh
Moana is probably the film where he fits in best. 
Yeah, I remember the Rock promoting it and really driving home how "real heroes" are first responders and all that hokey jargon that doesn't need to be used when you're trying to get people to watch a disaster movie starring a muscle on legs.
Yikes.
In that film he registers early on as, at a minimum, stronger than a bunch of first string NFL linebackers. Good movie, would recommend; Sean William Scott and Dwayne Johnson made a good pair, and it's hard not to love Christopher Walken as a villain, especially with a couple of the lines they gave him.
Nope, just like many movies that The Rock has since been cast in it's seems like they would justify it as "look he's The Rock, he's super strong, okay?"
I dont like it either. I admire his work ethic, but he really is too much for me, and I really dont like how everyone put so much praise in him and give him all the credit for the succes of the Fast movies, when its pretty clear if you have half a brain and understanding of the film business, that he was a very small part of it, and was VERY lucky to land a role in the one really GREAT Fast movie. It basically made him into a superstar.
“I guess you found my...achilles heel.”
[deleted]
That's true, but I think it's fair to say that he was still probably a big part of why Jumanji has made as much as it has. Barring his cameo in Jem and the Holograms, the guy hasn't had a flop since Faster in 2010, during which time he's 'starred' in 14 films. Whatever star power he has doesn't seem to be fading at the moment.
Chris Pratt was absolutely *part* of Jurassic World's appeal. It was his first movie following Guardians of the Galaxy.
Who upvotes this shit?
You can just watch just good movies, you know?
What's stopping you from not watching Rock's movies? 
[deleted]
I didn't consider voice acting work, but yeah, he was great in Moana!
Yeah, and not only that, but the family melodrama was superserious and overly emotional in a way that really didn't jive with me...
The movie is worth watching for Walken's tooth fairy speech.
Peter Berg movie if I'm not mistaken. Loved it as a teenager.
I mean punching bad guys really hard is a common action movie trope but even a professional boxer wouldn't be able to punch pillars like those and break them without breaking every bone in their hand.
Do people really attribute him that much success of the fast series? I could give him no more success than ANY of the veterans involved in that ensemble...least of all VIN FUCKING DIESEL!
"I guess he got off on the wrong foot"

>  is hugely successful because people fucking love dinosuars. 

i mean they do but that aint the reason. there no other dinosaur fanchise out there. its not like superhero  movies when even bad movies make bank or get picked up for sequels.

hell even the two jurrasic park sequels didnt make crazy ammounts of money either. 
[deleted]
Baywatch, Snitch, Hercules and central intelligence were all either flops or came in under expectations.

The rest of his movies since, were all big franchises with big names besides him like a Pixar Movie and the Fast movies.
Nothing. But it’s annoying to see him in the same generic action film. I want to see some different roles from him. Like Snitch. 
......? 
No, I agree. But I've seen majority of the movies he's in and they always have him doing some crazy impossible stuff simply based off the fact that he's The Rock.

If you have seen the quality of construction third world countries, you would not find it that unbelievable. It’s mostly cheap brick glued together with clay like mixture or adulterated cement. No rebar here. 
Many do, every time there is something about the fast movies, some douchebag The Rock fan shows up and says that if not for Dwayne, they would not have been succesful, as if it made fuck all difference if any other hunk of meat had his role in Fast Five, which overall was a great movie on its own. Nothing to do with the rock.
Didn't JP2 come out in a totally different film environment twenty goddamn years ago?
>He hasn't had a flop but none of the movies he carried made nearly as much as Jumanji. Which to me says it's more about the brand than the lead.

It didn't make as much as Jumanji, which to be fair has made a shit ton, but Johnson did carry San Andreas to $473 mil worldwide. This year will definitely be a test for him with two seemingly big budget movies (Skyscraper and Rampage) that have limited brand power on his slate.

I haven't seen Jumanji 2 yet, and I do share people's complaints about him to an extent, so it's nice to hear what you said about it. Hopefully he continues to branch out a bit going forward.
Not all of those made as much as their studios would have hoped, but **none of them were flops**. Baywatch made $177 mil on a $69 mil budget, Snitch $57 mil on an estimated $15 mil budget (Box Office Mojo only has the domestic BO for it, but those are the numbers Imdb and The-Numbers give), Hercules $244 mil on a $100 mil budget, and Central Intelligence $216 mil on a $50 mil budget. Using the old, a movie has to double its budget and then some at the box office to be profitable, while video sales make up for most of the marketing costs, all of those films should have made it into the green, and Central Intelligence by miles. I also wouldn't say Journey 2: The Mysterious Island ($335 mil) was a 'big franchise with big names beside him', but maybe that's just me.

Not to say the Rock's the biggest box office draw or that he's a complete success. But to have 14 films in a row where none of them are actual flops is pretty good and bodes well for his current appeal. He helps the films he's in. We'll see how he goes this year.
Are you specifically talking about Fast and Furious? *breaks cast*
Yeah try punching a cheap brick without hurting your hand
All buildings have rebars!
thats relevant how?

he said dinosaurs sale. they do but not every time. there arent any other dino franchises out there. many have tried but failed. 

the JP trilogy spanned 8 years and it kept making less and less money every time. 

superhero movies sale not dinosaur movies. bad superhero movies have made bank, bad dinosaur movies dont usually make bank. 
[deleted]
Baywatch was a major flop and it was all over the trades that it lost a ton of money. Central Intelligence also lost money. 

You are right that it has to double it budget, and thats just domestic. You have put in the overseas numbers also, which the studio see even less off. So no, a lot of the movies you mentioned and some of the others Rock has made, did not make money. Some might have gone breakeven or made a couple of million. But nothing exciting or great. He has been mediocre to say the least.

His biggest successes has been with the Fast movies, but the gross on those movies have nothing to do with him, and he aint the lead in those.

The is also Moana, but thats also nothing to do with him, thats a pixar disney cartoon, so that is gonna make money no matter what (although he was a great voice in it, he sang the shit out of it).

Journey was already a previous hit. So like with Jumanji, its coming of name recognition.

Brass tax, and if we are a bit mean about it. The only real "Rock" vehicle, where he had to carry it, and that was original, and not part of a previous franchise or any other property, that was a success, straight up, is San Andreas.


"Daddy gotta go to work."
Did you see the latest one? He punches a shipping container and leaves a massive indentation in it, and steers a torpedo with one hand.
> there arent any other dino franchises out there. many have tried but failed.

What other attempts have their been? 
Neither.  Alexandra Daddario
It's almost impossible to know since it's a combination. Disaster movies definitely have their regulars and consistent appeal, but San Andreas was one of the bigger ones in recent memory. The spectacle would have brought a minimum number of people in, and the Rock others.

At the end of the day, the logic, 'did audiences go for the actor or concept?' can be used for pretty much any movie, and true movie stars don't really exist anymore. If you don't think the Rock's a box office draw, I won't change your mind, but based on his box office history, I think audiences at least aren't being put *off* by him right now.
I remember reading articles about Baywatch flopping, but most of those were after it had been out only a couple weeks in the US, aka, before the international grosses had rolled in. I'd assumed it had broken even after that. Funnily enough, I was trying to account for the difference in domestic/overseas split (which I've heard typically involves studios getting 30-40% of the overseas and 60% of the domestic?) but it's all pretty complicated, with opening weekend cuts being higher, so you could very well be right. Looking it up, [Deadline determined in an article 1 and a 1/2 months after Baywatch's domestic release](http://deadline.com/2017/07/baywatch-box-office-success-overseas-despite-flop-in-america-1202123612/): '*Looking ahead, Baywatch likely will top out at around $110M* [overseas- and it made $119 mil overseas by the end for $177 mil worldwide]. *Is that cause enough to generate a sequel to the reported high-$60M-budgeted pic in what Paramount hoped would be a franchise-starter? No. Will the movie be profitable? With ancillary, yes.*' The caveat there is it that it would be profitable with ancillaries, but I think that still counts as making enough theatrically. It was a disappointment, but probably not a flop.

I'm gonna have to straight up dispute the claim that Central Intelligence lost money. In Deadline's 2017 write ups of 2016's most profitable films, [they wrote about CI that](http://deadline.com/2017/03/central-intelligence-box-office-profit-2016-1202046803/): '*the film’s global gross of $216 million on total costs of $184 million leaves New Line/Warner Bros with a net profit of $52 million when all ancillary revenues are counted, for a respectable cash on cash return of 1.28. Not sure if that’s good enough for a sequel, but it’s good enough to be No. 20 on our charts.*' Again, that's accounting for all revenue streams and all costs the film incurred, but the point is, it made enough in theatres to become profitable. It wasn't a flop.

The first Journey was definitely a success, making $241 mil, but the sequel came after a 4 year break, held loose connections to the first, and yet jumped to $335 mil. Even accounting for inflation, that's an $80 mil increase. I'd guess the Rock was probably a big part in that, because while the domestic takes were pretty much the same for both films, internationally, where the Rock tends to draw the biggest crowds, the box office increased. 

At the end of the day, I just don't think what popularity the Rock has is waning, and while you think his popularity at the box office is mediocre, I'd say it's a lot better than most actors and 'stars' these days.
