The "this fall" part made me lol
Am I the only one that thought of "littlefoot" when I saw this and thought they were about to remake Land Before Time
Danny DeVito
That *This Fall* joke was good. And I laughed when he just touched the guys face and knocked his tooth out. This actually doesn't look bad for a kids mov-

*JAMES CORDEN*

nevermind.
Journey really doesn't fit here.
I'm not sure when, if ever, it is appropriate to use "Don't Stop Believing" in your ad campaign, but this... is not it. 

I mean, I get it. The Yeti is not giving up on his belief that humans exist, but it's just such an overused song. 
I really hope this movie continues Warner Animation Group's streak of fun animated movies--they have that special something that's been missing from a lot of family films lately, and I admire that
I guess LeBron James is trying to get into acting. That seems...really weird to me. 
Of fucking course James Corden is in this. 
The This Fall bit was funny, but that otherwise looks incredibly bland and generic.
This looks so good
Showed this to my son. He was interested.
Hey that looks pretty good actually!

But seriously where the fuck are their noses?
i don't usually speak back to my monitor, but I'll be damned if I didn't say 'oh fuck you' out loud when I saw the 'This Fall' part.
It's the Logan of TLBT

*An aging littlefoot, having left the great valley years ago, is the last of his friends after a drought ruined the valley. He carries an old Petri on his back, too old to fly anymore.*
The Land before Time series in spanish are called "Little Foot" ("Pie Pequeño"), it's going to be confusing for some people.
**(NOT SO) FUN FACT:** The actor who voiced Ducky in The Land Before Time was murdered alongside her mother during a double murder suicide perpetrated by her father.
Is there a reason Reddit doesn't like James Corden? I know people were pretty cool with him for a while, and now it's a solid hatred from the hive mind. What happened?
Is this the new DAE hate Amy Schumer & Jimmy Fallon? 
Sounds like it conveyed the intended message.
He needs to build his credit for the space jam remake

He was really funny in Trainwreck. I could definitely see him getting a decent career in comedy movies
does it really bother you though?
I know, I want to see it sooner as well.
Now, I'm sad that this isn't a movie.
The meteor has already hit, and the Great Valley just took a bit longer to become uninhabitable to large animals compared to the rest of the world.
Not a hater, but I believe it has do with him being so non-controversial and marketing-friendly. Also, it appears that Hollywood is trying to push him as some new, upcoming comedian, which annoys some people. 

He'll be in 3 blockbuster films coming this year: this, _Peter Rabbit_ from last month, and _Teen Titans Go! To The Movies!_.

And he was in the Emoji Movie and Trolls. In short, he seems to be the go-to voice actor for shithole animated drivel.

 Don't hold your breath for *Sony's Calvin and Hobbes live action-cgi hybrid starring James Corden as Calvin and Busta Rhymes as Hobbes.The poster is Calvin dabbing while Hobbes takes a selfie and the trailer music is Roar by Katy Perry.*
And *Ocean’s Eight*
Eh I'd protest that trolls is a 'shit hole animated drivel' my niece really liked it, and so did I 
The poster will be Calvin peeing on something.
Wow if that happened I might actually have to kill myself.
I genuinely enjoyed Trolls. It was fun and simple.
