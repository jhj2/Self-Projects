Didn't Bucky fall off that train?
Jfc, chewie fucked that dude up
[deleted]
finally got some lando dialogue 
Oh fuck I really hope this “chewie” character makes it
Wait does chewie get killed by that rock when he is hanging off of the train???  What a cliffhanger to put in the trailer.
“I’m a driver, I’m a winner, things are gonna change, I can feel it.” 
Chewbacca is 190?!
Chewie's bodyslam was legendary.
Chewie got a lady? ok ok
I just want this movie to come out to see what r/prequelmemes does with it.
>	“I’ve got a really good feeling about this”

Wait a second... that’s not what he’s supposed to say
My favourite part of all of this might be how lucasfilm keeps surprising us with new ways to see Star Destroyers
Paul Bettany's character looks cool.
I hope this movie doesn’t go over the top with references to the other movies just for a nostalgia trip.
They're really doubling down on that terrible title card animation. 
When 190 years old, you reach… Look as good, you will not.
Chewie looks so young!
Jeez, I hope Chewbacca survives
Han: "Whad'ya think?"

Chewie: *disapproves*

Han: "Well what do you know?" 

I think that's the most Han Solo Alden has been from what we've seen so far. I like him. Don't care if he doesn't sound like Ford, I can see the subtle mannerisms coming through. 
He said push it, instead of punch it. I feel like we should be talking about that.
I still have no idea if this is going to be very good, but it at least looks like it'll be a pretty fun watch.
This... doesn't look half bad.

Still got some cliche dialogue but I'm really digging the aesthetic of the film. Very dark and gritty to make it feel like the era of the Empire.

20 bucks says the love interest is the one who betrays him.

That train scene is going to be the highlight of the film, for sure.

**EDIT:** >!I want my 20 bucks now.!<
So it's basically a heist film set in the Star Wars universe.. should be fun!
[deleted]
I love Glover, but I think it'd be better if Lando spoke the way he did in the original trilogy.
Ok, so what was that sound Chewey made after revealing his age?

I still can't get over the Toy Story font they're using for the title cards.
Love me a good train heist
Honestly, nothing in that trailer really grabbed me.  It's not like the Force Awakens trailer where just seeing the Falcon was enough to get the entire world oh-shit-hyped.

I don't know.  The film looks competent?  But who the hell knows. 
I like the new droid, another cool character after K2SO 
Chewie with more to do in this trailer than the last two movies.
Let's talk about Rampart.
I still can’t see Han in this but... I’m still mildly looking forward to it. 
Is it a requirement now to have a snarky robot in every Star Wars film? Could we have not gone one movie without one?
idk something about Ehrenreich still seems off to me, Lando looks and sounds great tho 
Does anyone else think the 'SOLO' animation at the end of these trailers looks... awful? Like, it looks like the Toy Story logo to me and not in a good way. 
Yeah... idk about this. This is the first Star Wars movie I don't feel hyped for. Not as big of a fan as I used to be.
Lando Calrissian played by Donald Glover is about as convincing as Han Solo played by Michael Cera
I’m trying to keep an open mind with this movie, I really am. But holy crap, Alden Ehrenreich is just *not* selling me on this role at all. 
Fucking spoilers man, I haven't seen Justice League yet.

Edit: Some of you guys are really missing the punchline here...
That train actually just goes in a thirty mile circuit around the mountain. If you've got a side kick who needs to fall to an ambiguous fate you need to book the train up to a year in advance and you only get a thirty minute slot. 
It was Nathan Drake actually. 
Snowpiercer
Went straight to the comments to see if anyone else was thinking the exact same thing.  Its like a Marvel movie but with Starwars DLC characters.
Who the hell is bucky?
Nah he's with me until the end of the line
SOLO A STAR WARS STORY 2 THE WINTER WOOKIE
Yeah, pretty sure Chewie just **killed** a guy in the *trailer*.  Jesus...
The guy whose head is now inside his chest cavity?
and omg that cliff hanger at the end. I have to know whether Chewie makes it or not
Best part of the trailer. Wookies have always had this badass rep, but hardly get a chance to do some serious damage on screen. Looks like that's gonna change 
Chewy slammed first.
>https://gifs.com/gif/solo-a-star-wars-story-official-trailer-E92nom

Had to make a gif for that. 
Yeah, I found that pretty jarring.

"Holy shit, Chewie just broke that dude's neck."
Will Lumpy finally make his return to canon?
Right. Does anyone know what they are trying to steal? Could the whole train heist be getting Chewie's family back? It would make for a great reason why Chewie stays with his pet Han
Where Lumpy at???
I demand Bea Arthur. 
[deleted]
Malla is now canon
I bet this movie is Donald Glover's audition for a Lando spinoff film.
He nails everything but the voice, it just doesn't sound like Lando.
I'm missing Billy Dee Williams already
Plot twist: he died and Han got a new one afterwards.
This reminds me--

My uncle saw Empire before my dad did and told my father, "The wookie dies."

When my dad went to see it a few days later he expected Chewie to die at any minute.  That never happened, for obvious reasons.  When the end credits rolled he thought, "How are they going to kill him now?"
Don't worry, it's not a moon.
I'm worried about that rock. I think it got him.
Nah, he dies and his son Chewie Jr. takes over. He prefers to just go by "Chewie" though.
Plus points for involving actual hanging, and an actual cliff.
Rumor has it that he does.
He gets killed by a rock but not that one....
Soooooooy un perdedor
So glad I wasn't the only one who thought of this.
He was a young ~175 when he was pals with Yoda on Kashyyyk
When this movie takes place. He is 230+ during The Last Jedi 
Wait how are years even measured in a galaxy far, far away? 
WWE contract incoming.
BAH GAWD HE IS BROKEN IN HALF
I have a feeling that Chewie's backstory is going to be the saddest part of the film. Being a Wookie in the times of the Empire seems like it must've  been hard.
I mean he had a family in the old canon.

Who could forget that little shit Lumpy?
Life Day is coming back. 
She likes to watch cooking shows 
Imagine if this is R rated..
They'll be coarse and rough and irritating, and get everywhere.
Whatever it is, I bet it will involve quoting the prequels. 
"This film will make a fine addition to my collection"

-- r/prequelmemes
*Looks at prequel memer* We will be looking at your career with great interest
This is where the fun begins!
whatever happened to /r/anthologymemes ?
*sees new movie*

"Are we blind, deploy the memers!"
They're just about out of material, so this should be a welcome breath of fresh air.
He is altering the line.  Pray he does not alter it further.
In Rogue One, K2SO is interrupted before he actually finishes the line.  Inverting it here somehow feels right to me.
"Push it Chewie!" 

Seems like that's gonna be a potential running joke. 
It's a really good design, just a great shape. There are no bad angles from which to film a Star Destroyer.
I came out of Rogue One sounding like some sort of Star Destroyer fetishist. Glad to see others giving Star Destroyers the healthy, natural respect and admiration they deserve.
I'm glad he's getting actual good work now instead of doing shit movies like Mordecai. Age of Ultron really set him on a better pathway.

But then again, he's married to Jennifer Connelly, so life can't be that bad for him.
Dryden Vos and fuck yeah he does. Those energy fisticuff-knifes tho
I am pretty sure he is cast in the role that Michael K. Williams was supposed to portray but had to drop when the reshoots were scheduled. Was originally supposed to be a fully CGI character, so I would love to see concept art of what the big bad was originally supposed to look like. 
Depends what you consider over the top. We absolutely will get things like how Han won the Falcon, and the dice obviously come from the game he won. That’s all fine to me. I just don’t want “Han shooting first” and a ton of meta stuff like that.
Does Woody Harrelson kiss the gun Han will use from them on? Because it looked like that to me. 
I'd guess that's one of the positives of Ron Howard coming on board. All the previous Disney era Star Wars directors (not including the Rogue One reshoots) grew up with Star Wars and loved it as kids. Ron Howard has a very difference perspective on the movies - and George Lucas who he worked with on American Graffiti - and is probably a lot less of a fanboy. I'd be willing to bet the Lord and Miller version would have had a lot more references considering their previous movies.
Every time I see it I start singing “solo, I’m Han Solo solo” in my head
# AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE IT DAMN IT
That's the thing throwing me off the most. Not a fan, hopefully it will change before show time. 
Well he does look great. 
I saw a spoiler that [he does. Apparently so does Han who has a child and goes on to have a long happy life.](#spoiler)
As long as it's written well, he should be fine.

Must suck getting so much flak about your acting skills before the movie even comes out.
I mean,he's Young Solo,not the same Han Solo played by Harrison Ford.
IMO he sounds and acts like someone who will be Han Solo one day,like McVoy made his Young Xavier a character believable enough to be Stewart Xavier in the future. 
Yeah, same with the “you look great” and the “I’ve got a good feeling about this.”  I honestly have a good feeling about this.  Could it be awful, yes, but I’m still hyped.
I feel like his delivery was surprisingly very Han Solo. I mean, he sounds nothing like him, but the way he said it was all there. Feeling a lot better about this movie
I don't know why, but that really bugged me during the trailer.
I said the very same thing when the Rogue One trailer came out. Then, just like the rebels, I was blown away at the end of the film.
It reminded me of the train level from Shadows of the Empire 64.
Evil Emilia Clarke would be great... and add a new layer to why Han doesn't trust seemingly "noble causes". Then when he discovers just how genuinely devoted Leia is to the Rebels it would actually make him love her more (though he'd never admit it).
If the worse thing that can be said about the movie is 'cliche', I'll be relieved.
I mean its Ron Howard so I'm not expecting it to be terrible. It looks like they played it pretty safe. Still I have to wonder what the Lord and Miller cut was like. 
> Still got some cliche dialogue

Wouldn't be a Star Wars movie without some cheesy dialogue.
And pretty much guaranteed no force users will be interesting 
The trailer almost makes it look like an origin story for the Millennium Falcon.
Wasn't that the same description used for *Rogue One*? 
>film people

Who are they?
Can someone explain why this comment got gold
"Give or take"??
"Get off my lawn"
Shadows of the Empire train level.
It's hard for the Falcon to be hype when it's essentially been the hype vehicle for every Disney SW film except Rogue One. 
They need to slow down with movie releases. Star Wars just isn't supposed to be a yearly thing. 
Honestly I'm going to be dissatisfied in all star wars movies from now on that don't have a human shaped Droid who is a sarcastic assole.
Every time it talked I thought it was Phasma???
I was thinking that people were talking a lot about CGI Leia and Tarkin, but Star Wars' latest droids like this dude and K2SO have been entirely CG and totally lifelike and amazing. They really deserve props for that.
What do you mean "now"? Name a Star Wars movie without one.
He's just not quite as charismatic as Harrison ford. But you can forgive a little, because... like... Harrison Ford was one of the most charismatic leading men in cinema history.
I think Ehrenreich just has a higher hill to climb. Ford is one of the most iconic actors. Donald Glover doesn't look or sound anything like Billy Dee Williams, yet everyone is giving universal praise for him. That's because Billy Dee Williams is not on the same status level as Ford, so Glover doesn't have to meet anyone's expectations for portraying Lando. 
His delivery of every line sounds kinda flat. There’s not much flavor in him so far. 
Same, I just feel like the movies aren't what they used to be. And I know, I know rose-tinted glasses and all. The new movies just don't feel the same.

Star Wars just doesn't feel special anymore. It used to feel special when the movies were spaced out and in a set trilogy. Now, they're releasing one every year, trilogy or not. 
This is what happens when companies decide to annualize their properties.
Well I mean he's someone who isn't Harrison Ford trying to *be* Harrison Ford. The whole premise was flawed from the start. Why they chose this story instead of picking from the million other ripe story lines in the Star Wars universe is beyond me.

That said, I'm still looking forward to this. I think Chewie might end up being the glue that holds this movie together.
This is probably the hardest role to take on for any actor. So many people have Ford in mind, and no one is going to be able to replicate his charisma, voice, mannerisms, etc. I think we'll all enjoy the movie more if we go in not expecting a Ford impression, but if he legitimately puts in a good performance. 
I guess we will wait till the movie.

It's because we are so used to ford
He's also way too short to be Han (which I know he can't control, but the casting team messed that up).

"worst ambiguous sidekick death train ever"

⭐⭐🚫🚫🚫

When the time came for the train to lurch sideways and my trusted sidekick to dramatically fall into the void, it became apparent that the staff didn't take their job seriously. The troopers they had on Train Battle duty barely even pretended to shoot at us, missing us by 8-16 feet. They often doubled up on passengers due to a lack of staff to adequately operate all of the stations. And I haven't even mentioned the ambiguity of the fall. I could easily see my sidekick smash onto a rock, leaving no room for assumptions about his fate.

 Unacceptable!

However, I must grant a star, as the basil chicken platter was lovely. My compliments to the chef.

-Grandmaster Flash
Ah man I fucking love that game. It has a special place in my heart
*Sully voice* 

Goddammit, Nate!

Fr tho one of the best game series of all time. I just beat Lost Legacy and enjoyed every minute of it
I'm literally sitting on the menu screen for that game right now
Chewie kills a lot of people in Star Wars, although this is probably the first time he did it by shoving the dude's head into his lungs
Yeah that escalated quickly. I mean it really got out of hand. 
Yeah, that one!
He dies but he has a twin brother also named Chewbacca.
I couldn’t agree more. I recently rewatched all the Star Wars movies and the on screen examples of Wookiee doesn’t really show the ferocious badass nature that they get credit for, other than references to ripping peoples arms off we don’t really ever see a Wookie destroy anyone hand to hand
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Cheers, I didn't feel like watching the whole trailer again to see what everyone's freaking out about
[deleted]
Lumpy is Snoke. 
He already made his return to canon in the new books.

Seriously.
Actually shes been canon for awhile. She and Lumpy are both referenced (and I think there is even a chapter from Lumpy's POV) in the Aftermath trilogy
Honestly I would be 200x more excited if it was a Lando spinoff. If I end up watching this (which I will because I'm a fucking sheep), Don Glover is like 80% of the reason why.
I'm hoping both Donald and Alden knock it out of the park, because I want those two supporting Sebastian Stan in a post-RotJ Luke film. 
Fun fact: Don Glover was in his 20's before he realised his name could also read as: DonG lover. I remember him remarking on it in an interview. 
I can't unsee him as Troy. When he's sitting at the table i 100% believe there are notches. 
>Lando spinoff film

This could be really cool. It would have a lot more room to get creative and unique than most spinoffs, since Lando doesn't have a ton of expectations and backstory already attached to him. Whoever developed this would have a lot of freedom to try cool ideas free from the restrictive expectations imposed on the Solo film. 
sounds like Troy pretending to be Lando
Yep instantly threw me off. I hope it's not that bad for the entire movie cuz it's going to be annoying for me. Shit like this is why I think the only safe bet for a Star Wars spinoff is the Obi Wan spinoff because you have someone ready to play the character who's already established as said character and not just some new actor portraying a younger version of the character. 
“WE ARE CHEWIE.”
“This is actually Chewie 2, but we don’t ever call him that in front of the kids.”
Plot twist: Han dies, so Chewie gets a new pet and it's the Han played by Harrison Ford. 
Chewie's brother names Louie and chewie told him everything about han and their gang, so no need for introductions and they should just call him Chewie in honor of his dead brother.
Probably drop a moon on him, or something.
[deleted]
Someone told my brother the same thing before he saw TFA. He kept expecting Chewie to die and his jaw hit the floor when he saw who actually died lol
I was watching Overwatch twitch streams the day before I was going to see The Last Jedi and someone spoiled it by saying that Kylo died.

I went the whole movie thinking he was going to die. I'm still not sure if that made the film better or worse for me. 
"Can you guys just call me landfill and act like nothing happened"
he's succeeded by his son Lumpy, who inherits his name in the wookie tradition
I’m a loser babyyyy
Wait that's what he's saying?

All this time I thought it was "Sooooo, oh-open the door"

This makes much more sense 
I had no idea that wasn't english until just now but now it makes a lot more sense to my brain.

Man, I'm a loser, baby, so why don't ya kill me.

And when he was helping Ahsoka fight off those Trandoshan hunters.
Is this during the droid attack on the Wookiees?
30 years passed since these two events? 
Average wookiee lifespan is 400 years according to wiki 
>Wait how are years even measured in a galaxy far, far away? 

http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Standard_Calendar

TL;DR: The galaxy uses the Calendar of Coruscant which has 368 days in a year. 

Granted, this is only from Legends which is considered non-canon, but it could easily be re-canonized in the future.
In parsecs
I've never read it but i think in legends he was a slave and han saved him
In Legends, the Wookiees were the Empire's favorite species of slave labor used to build the Death Stars.

>But then again, he's married to Jennifer Connelly, so life can't be that bad for him.
Remember his Crazy Priest phase? Legion, Priest, Da Vinci Code. Great stuff.
Yeah I mean its not too shabby eh?
Tbh, I wish Jennifer would get these badass roles, here's hoping!
I completely agree. I’m fine with finding out about the origins of things but I don’t want too much in terms of just references to lines he said in the other movies.
A few small references would be fine, but yeah not too much cheese please.
That DID look a lot like his trusty DL-44
Can we just talk about Rampart please
I'd like to be able to watch the original trilogy without thinking "Woody Harrelson kissed that" every time Han whips out his piece.

Oh well, haha.
> Ron Howard has a very difference perspective on the movies - and George Lucas who he worked with on American Graffiti - and is probably a lot less of a fanboy.

In one of the many Star Wars documentaries (sorry, not sure which one) he talks about seeing the first one in a theatre with his wife and how he was blown away from the opening scene. 

When the movie ended he and his wife walked out of the theatre and without really saying a word to each other got in line to go to the next showing.
That's a really good point. I remember Gareth Edwards describing working on Rogue One as "playing with toys" or something along those lines. 

What is selling me on this movie so far is just how different and unique it looks compared to other Star Wars movies. It actually looks engaging, and not just a copy/paste of things we've already seen. Which is funny, because it seemed like a pretty unnecessary origin story for a character from the original trilogy, yet it looks like it has more originality than any of the other new movies so far.

I await the countless YouTube re-edits that replace the real soundtrack with music from Star Wars Kinect.

Better than I would at 190 years old.
Idk don’t trust leaks. 
Lando is also rumored to survive. But take that with a grain of salt. 
Really? An inside source reported that Han dies, and Emilia Clarke's character marries Chewbacca. A lot of mystery surrounding this film
I suppose that's just part of the risk of taking over such an iconic character, not only does your performance have to be good on its own merits, it has to do right by the established character.

Still not sold on his voice or Glover's yet, but I'm interested to see where they take it. The actual dialogue and mannerisms seem appropriate.
Lawrence Kasdan has been involved with 3/4 movies that feature Han Solo. This makes it 4/5. I think from the writing aspect of the character it’ll be okay.
It is written by the guys who came up with ~90% of all the Han dialogue in the Episodic films, so it should be well written. 
>Must suck getting so much flak about your acting skills before the movie even comes out.

Particularly when it's simply because you aren't the same actor who used to play a character. 
What's the age difference between Young Solo and OG Trilogy Han? He couldn't have been that old.
This trailer is a lot better plus we finally get Lando lines. I'm a lot more confident about it than a few months ago.
Yea, as soon as I saw the train scene I knew where that came from. I doubt the music will reach the epicness of that part though.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX0ZhhOd0Hg

Fuck yeah. But also fuck that level. 
And then at the end you have to fight one of the IG-88 droids and he just jumps all over the place fucking you up. Man, that was a stressful game.
[deleted]
Agreed. This could really just be a cliche heist film in space and I'm all for it, because the Star Wars universe can easily make such a generic template feel fresh.
Considering they never finished filming the movie, no such cut would exist.
Ron Howard is my favorite director who has consistently been bombing at the box office. I feel bad for the dude, but glad that Hollywood still has faith in his directing skills, because most of his films are great.
They might pull a unique way of integrating the Force like Chirrut, but considering Han's utter lack of faith in the Force in the OT this would have to be very minimal, likely from one of the villains rather than one of the crew.
They're dead. Every single one of them, and not just the men, but the women… and the children too. They're like animals. I HATE THEM!
[Because of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/)
This gives me hope for a KotOR movie. HK-47 warms my meatbag central power core.
I'm going to be dissatisfied that all Star Wars movies have the same sarcastic asshole droid character because it will make the movies feel like they're being made to template. I'm charmed by them like everyone, but there's a lot of different droids you could have. 
What about a sarcastic porg?
I'm glad to see someone else thought the same thing.
Yeah the dude has big shoes to fill and honestly I don't think he will totally pull it off.

I won't count it against him or the movie though, the OT was insanely lucky with its casting.
Even in his first movie, the charisma was already there.

That's why I'm not a fan of another actor portraying Han. It'll be impossible not to compare him to Harrison. 
Even River Phoenix had trouble playing a younger Harrison Ford.
I was really looking forward to seeing footage of Glover finally speaking as Lando. Not gonna lie, I'm kind of disappointed to say I was underwhelmed. I'm sure the tiny bit we've seen in this trailer isn't indicative of his entire performance though; he's pulled through every other time. 
Or because Glover is kind of a fan favorite and has plenty of performances that people like

But he does look like Lando. Idk why people say he doesn’t. Look up a picture of them side by side. 
Exactly. Was about to say the same thing. As portrayed by Ford, Han Solo has such a greater hold on our perception of the character than Billy Dee Williams could ever do for Lando. 

Basing it solely on screen time which has a good impact on...well, impact, IMDB nicely just told me that in the OT, Han Solo gets roughly 4x the screen time of Lando. And that doesn't even speak to the talent of the actor, the writing or delivery of the lines, or the editorial or story-based weight placed on the character's scenes, etc...

So yeah, it's really easy to see an already appreciated performer as doing a great job as a fairly under-represented character while likewise not having any goodwill for an unknown actor to translate into the portrayal of a widely known and beloved character.

TLDR: Poor Alden Ehrenreich never had a chance...

Edit: Link for screen time via IMDB, again, only looking at the OT: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls027631145/
Would that it twere so simple
Yeah I almost want him to ham it up a bit and really go for it. Maybe he will though, we’ve not seen much. 
Seems too stiff for a harrison ford character
I'm with you. Almost 40 and I was super excited about TFA and after watching it, I was able to enjoy it but I was wanting something totally new and I was predicting major plot points just by how much it was mirroring ANH. I forced myself past all that and accepted it into my Star Wars heart. Then TLJ came in and erased any doubt that these aren't going to be movies that I had hoped for. Not only that but to me they are souring old characters... namely Luke. I HATE Rian's interpretation and I think Hamill was 100% correct in his early criticism. Then the plot holes and cartoony decisions just ruined all hope from me. 

For that reason, and the fact that I thought a Han Solo movie was the dumbest fucking idea they could have thought of, I am not looking forward to it. It's the first time in my life I haven't been off the walls about an upcoming Star Wars movie. Usually by now I would be excited and have my midnight screening tickets ready but as it is I'm not sure I'm even going to see it in theaters. 
What blows my mind about it, is that Harrison Ford was Han Solo in The Force Awakens.  It isn't like he died in the end of the original trilogy and we kind of lost track of what the character really had going for him.  We had a very recent reminder of who Harrison Ford's version of Han Solo is.

They could have waited until the trilogy ended and made this movie and it wouldn't feel so weird to see someone else play Han Solo, because Han Solo wouldn't be as fresh in everyones mind.
I agree. Can't wait for the sequel *I'll be Bacca: A Chewy Story*
I think even Ehrenreich was thinking too hard about Ford in this role. You can see it in his expressions. Whoever was the director or acting coach really should've tried to bring as much of his individuality as possible instead of replicating a character that you'll never be able to match. 
> This is probably the hardest role to take on for any actor.

Some actor once had to play a young version of Brando's Don Corleone. Bob something. I wonder what happened to him?
It's also not like Ford hasn't played the role since ROTJ or something, he just played it a little over 2 years ago. 
Ford was always going to be impossible to replicate.

I wouldn't want to be the actor that has to try to step into his shoes.
Aren't you a little short for a ~~stormtrooper~~ Han Solo?
Damn these memes are quick. 
Justice League had its moments. 

All 2 of them. 
Uncharted 2 is one of the best games all time. God I miss having a PlayStation. Got an Xbox one cause of friends, kinda regret it.

Yeah, Chewy's family were canon even under George Lucas, which I always thought was funny given how much he hated how the Holiday Special turned out.
I'd say there's a 90% chance we get a Lando spinoff film eventually.

Donald Glover is just so damn liked/marketable/popular.
Fuuuuuuuuck I want that now too. 
That wouldn't really make any sense though? 

Prequels are one thing, but having Luke be played by Mark Hamill in the OT, to Sebastian Stan in a spin-off, back to Mark Hamill in the new trilogy...that's a little silly. Same goes for Alden and Donald, especially with them all looking significantly younger than OT Han and Lando. By the time they get to be the ages of Harrison and Billy in RotJ, they probably won't even look like them at all. 
The chances of that getting through his whole school life untouched are next to 0.
Well, he did grow up very repressed in a Jehova's Witness family. Also, he's a comedian, so he could have been doing a bit. A lot of comedians try out new bits on late night shows.
I think he reserved it as an alternate twitter handle: https://twitter.com/donglover
Troy and Solo in the morning.
To be fair, Ewan was cast to play a newer, younger Guinness. He just had three movies to make a mark as the definitive Kenobi.

Damnit Iris. 
Is that an EU reference?
Fake spoilers are fun sometimes.
It seemed so obvious that it was coming though.

This one gets my upvote, because it has more y's. 
That was a solid clone wars arc
Actually yes.
Yeah that doesn't sound right...
He was 180 at the start of the Clone Wars.  22 years before the Death Star was destroyed.  So assuming he's 190 in this movie, that takes place 12 years before the original Star Wars.
nah he was 181 in ep 3. That puts this 9 years after ep 3. Making Solo  19. Seems perfectly fine to me

How many is that in dog years?
Well how long is a day on Coruscant? Hell, how long is a day anywhere? How the hell do they all keep to their schedules as they're going from planet to planet?
That's why Chewie swore a life debt to Han

Yeah Han was an officer (maybe a pilot?) And he saved Chewie
Not just legends. Thrawn in current canon uncovered the Empire using Wookiee slaves for the Death Star construction. He was *visibly* repulsed by it, but accepted that he is in no position to do anything about it, and it's just "how the Empire does things".

So a perfect family basically.
I just watched the Holiday Special recently (because youtube suggested it) without knowing how shit it is... Man, that was really bad, and not in a so-bad-it's-good kinda way, except maybe the grandpa watching VR porn thing.

This is where the fun begins

Yippie!

"I've got a really good feeling about this."
I think that was one of the better parts of TFA, Han and Chewie had great character development without relying on the original trilogy too much. Moments like "Chewie, we're home" were great, but they weren't the bulk of their scenes. Hopefully this movie is able to introduce a younger Han that has an interesting story to tell, without relying too much on what we already know comes later.
Fair point. I didn't mean to imply he wasn't a fan, what I was really trying to say is that Star Wars isn't a formative experience for him because he was already a director when it came out. For directors like JJ Abrams, Star Wars is probably a big part of why they became a director in the first place and that love will bleed through into his movies, Howard has a very different perspective.
Really shows what bang-up job Chris Pine did stepping into Kirk's shoes. He brought a really balanced portrayal of William Shatner's Kirk with some of his own flair. 

Hope Alden pulls this off.
It's not their voice, but their deliveries that matter.
Mark Hammill does a great Harrison Ford impersonation. Should've cast him instead.
Since he's the one who wrote Empire, he's the one who wrote his history with Lando, basically the first one who wrote Han as having a "backstory". That, and he probably has thought about it for decades now. It'll be okay.
Solo takes place between 11-14 years before ANH.
Awsome music, PTSD level 
One of the clearest memories from this game was the terror of being chased by a wampa then learning that you could lure it to kill all the snowtroopers.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete?
Dailies though. There's a reason KK was able to be concerned.
Something like this could certainly fall into the “simple tricks and nonsense” category of the Solo belief system.

Canderous and HK for life on Dark Side runs.
He probably had to feel so much pressure trying to 'replace' Harrison Ford. 

I couldn't handle that.
I mean... he was damn good.
And it was forgivable for River since he was portraying a teen Ford, so he was able to get away with some things since we don't know what Ford was like at that age. Alden Ehrenreich has to play Ford at an age when we actually have a real reference to compare to.  
He did a pretty damn good job, actually.
Yeah honestly, reading people bashing Ehrenreich while praising Glover's portrayal based on that one line, I was like, "really....?" I think we're all biased since Glover is more popular and we know what we can expect from him. Let's give Ehrenreich a chance.  
Professor Professorson?
I think you hit it on the head. They could easily have pulled out some other story rather than doing Solo right now. He'll, he died in VII, if they'd just waited til after IX I think it'd have been easier to pull off.
[deleted]
All Disney had to do was watch those YouTube vids of the dude who does Harrison ford impressions and they would have been fine. ^/s
They should have just cast someone who can play a character like Han. Donald Glover doesn't sound like Lando but I see some of the coolest parts of Lando in him.
That's the meme that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.

To be fair, if done right, the Holiday Special is [a hell of a story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Holiday_Special).  There's Chewie, hero of the Rebellion.  He's headed back to Kashyyyk, where his family and friends are preparing to celebrate Life Day. Imperials toss the house, looking for evidence of the family's involvement in the Rebellion.

Imagine it recut, or even redone using the Star Wars Rebels assets.
I' say there's a 40% chance this turns out to be Glover's Lando movie instead of Ehrenreich's Solo movie
But he's no Lando suave. I still don't feel any *sexiness* there. 
Feels crazy to think not that many years ago I was watching Derrick Comedy videos wondering when this kid would get a shot,  and now it's like "they will probably be making another Star Wars movie for him"

Talk about a meteoric rise
I want Teddy Perkins and Benny to show up and take down the sith

Punch it, Chewie!
Yes, that is how Chewie died in the EU.  
After the final episode of last season's GoT I texted my friend saying [Sansa dies in the episode](#spoiler). He cursed me to no end for spoiling it and proceeded to watch the episode expecting her to die. He later told me the fake spoiler made it so much better for him. So yeah fake spoilers are fun more often than not I guess.
Yeah, they telegraphed the living shit out of it. 
Get crazy with the cheez whiz
Double barrel buckshot!
What episodes did that happen in?
looks like they finally heard /r/prequelmemes and are giving em what they want. i will be watching this movies career with great interest
Especially since this took place before Rebels, which is 15 years after Chewbacca saw Yoda for the last time.
9 cats.
>Well how long is a day on Coruscant? 

I very glad you asked! Because the wiki page clearly says:

>60 seconds = 1 minute[5]

>60 minutes = 1 hour[5]

>24 hours = 1 day[5]

>5 days = 1 week[5]

>7 weeks = 35 days = 1 month[5]

>10 months + 3 festival weeks + 3 holidays = 368 days = 1 year[5]

Obviously it is meant to closely correspond to our calendar.
And then you make him kill Mission.

Wait... 
Oh yeah, the part about Han being in the Empire at one point- I was never sure if that was canon, head canon, noncanon or retconned.
Grandpa Lou Pickles had some dirty secrets.
Holy fuck, 8-year-old me had no idea. 😫
Holy shit
really? i dont remember that
Yippeeee!
Game time started.
So it's treason then.
Some version of that line is in every Star Wars movie though. Just cuz they put that line in doesn't mean there will be a ton of other cheesy references.
Howard also turned down directing Star Wars in the past 
He didn’t really even try to mimic Shatner until the last minutes of the first movie. I had no problem with Pine as Kirk or Quinto as Spock, but I was blown away at how amazing Karl Urban was as McCoy. I was the odd girl out who’s favorite was McCoy and I was really worried about the movie until I saw and heard Urban as Bones. It was the scene where he first meets Kirk and says “Space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness and silence!” That was so sweet. 

I have hopes that this Han Solo movie will have that moment where you stop seeing the actor and just see the characters acted. 
Exactly. Martin Freeman didn't *sound* like the established Bilbo, and that was faaaar from being the issue with The Hobbit movies.
I've always thought that the dude who voices the Joker should be in more live-action stuff. Star Wars would be *perfect* for him!
Oh, Harrison Ford does a wicked Han Solo impersonation, they should've cast him!
That's what I would like to see too, somebody claiming to be able to use the force but he turns out to be a fraud 
It's Canderous. Or Mandalore. Take your pick.
"...Everybody's lost but me."

I think one of Billy Dees most signature aspects is his deep, and honestly beuatiful voice. Donald simply does not have that.
Everyone on the internet is a casting director.
The credits
In all honesty, I really like the scene where Barry's dad is telling him to give up on him.  It was the one spot in the film where the characters felt like real people I should give a shit about.
I loved the scene towards the end where Barry is totally happy to have saved that family and then Superman one-ups him by carrying away an entire apartment building. That was some Silver Age shit right there. 
Gals smile
Superman staring down the Flash was badass the rest of the movie left no impression on me...
You mean the flash v superman "fight" it's definitely a high point
3 scences, it also had that flashback where you see the gods and a green lantern :D Yup, 3 cool scenes. 
Best final act of all the Uncharted games is in Lost Legacy. Really great game. 

4>2>LL>3>1

Fucking hard to rank though because I do love them all
I loved Uncharted 4, but Lost Legacy might actually be a little bit better.  Great story, great characters, and some of the best action of any Uncharted game.

Naughty Dog doesn't know how to make bad video games.
Not just decapitates - if I'm remembering the animation correctly he tears both their arms off, they look at the holes where there were arms, and then explode. **From the pain**

It's a little less dramatic than I've described it as, but [here](https://youtu.be/MSKBzvsrfNw).
... because you're probably wanted for murder.
I don't know.
If you have to ask, you can't afford it.
I was plum surprised
Vader doesn't mind that so much. It's incompetence that makes him want to choke  a bitch. 
Also the only guy to tell the guy who's been strangling every naysayer to death that he wants compensation if Han dies.
He also has his own rap and has a Corvette
I've got a good feeling about this.

That doesn't add up does it how long of a time period is Sith supposed to be? They excute order 66 when he sees Chewbacca and then shortly after Anakin gets fucked up and luke and Leia are born which should be about a 18ish year time between this and A New Hope.
I always felt bad about corrupting Zaalbar. 
Honestly if your darkest secret is that you watch sci fi cosplay porn, you're probably a pretty decent person all things considered. 
Han, Chewie Sinjir and a band of wookies go to kashyyk to liberate them. They all had those implants in their heads that would drive them mad, and to death if they stepped out of line. 
I am the excitement.
> Some version of that line is in every Star Wars movie though

Yes, but this one is obviously a play on that fact. Every single other time the line is "I've got a bad feeling about this."

I kinda liked the reference though. It's sort of like in Casino Royale when Bond was asked "shaken or stirred," and he responded, "Do I look like I give a damn?!"
Urban killed that role and continues to. He did his research that’s for sure. 
I would like to join the McCoy-is-best group please. My dad and I used to get up early to watch the show when I was a kid and McCoy always made me laugh more than anyone else. 
I love McCoy and I think Karl Urban does such a wonderful job! You can really tell he respects the character; he wasn't sure if he was coming back for Beyond because he wanted them to be truer to McCoy (and I think Justin Lin did a great job with that).

I think I remember Leonard Nimoy giving an interview where he states that upon seeing Urban's first moments as McCoy, he burst into tears because it was so much like his friend.
"You just sat a man down at a high stakes poker game with no cards and told him to bluff!" - Karl Urban as McCoy. He's the best thing about those movies, hands down.
Karl Urban is pretty much the most underestimated actor in any given movie. I sincerely hope he keeps getting the roles that he loves and let him be seen so more people can appreciate what he's putting into his work.
Hell, Martin Freeman as Bilbo was one of the best things about those movies. 
Yes but Bilbo or the actor who played him are hardly Harrison Ford level status where everyone and their mother can hear his voice in their head. 
Or have it in the same sense of a magician, just some kind of trick that is not super practical but you can win a bet on
Doesn't even have to be deep, in my opinion. He just needs the smooth, chill cadence that Williams has/had. In the trailer it doesn't even look like he's trying for it, though.
How is the feeling of knowing that you just lost 2 hours to a movie where nothing cool happens except for Ezra Miller a good moment?
I couldn't give a shit bc I've seen that in the Flash show too many times. 
You know what? You're right. That was fucking hilarious and extremely true to character
Question. Why would he bother fighting people in real time when he could just finish them off in half a second. 
Flash running by Superman, who turns to look at him.  And Flash's "Oh shit" look.  I love that part.

I suggest a new strategy: let the wookie win
Savage 
"I'm sorry, did you just say the thing turned inside out, and then it exploded?"  
"Hold please!"

That's true, Vader got backtalk from his coworkers kind of often. Boba's ballsy but that still doesn't cancel out that he had one of the dumbest deaths in the series.
I like thinking he allowed backtalk-to a point-because of how mouthy he was during the Clone Wars. If you get results and do your job well, you’re entitled to a bit of lip. This is all head-cannon however. 
And not only doesn't get choked but receives a promise of payment if anything goes wrong. Maybe Anakin likes him because he's a clone
60% of the time it works every time. 
Things are gonna change, I can feel it.

just watched them...really enjoyed....the series is starting to go places now....things are getting a lot more depth to them.
Most of those "moral" choices in games like KOTOR or Mass Effect didn't give me much of an emotional response beyond "oh wow that was mean" but that...that one hurt
I actually can't go Dark Side. If the option is there, I'm okay a good character. 
You underestimate the sheer debauchery of that porn DVD that Grandpa Pickles is watching. It makes Naughty Nurses 2 look like Crotch Capers 3!
Now this is memeing!
yeah I didn't mind the one in the trailer at all
I also like that if you count the subversion in Rogue One (K2 goes to say it and only gets a few words out before he's told to shut up) it seems like the trend is to have the real line in the saga movies, and subvert it in the standalones, which is hilarious
He did the same thing for Dredd. Heck he even was solid against the Rock in the Doom movie.

Martin Freeman nailed that performance. His delivery and mannerisms were perfect.
The Hobbit is a lot of fun when it focuses on Bilbo and his adventure. It is why I think the first movie is the strongest (although it is still way too long), and the Smaug section in the second is also great. The third movie is just a big battle that has no stakes or involvement from Bilbo, which is why it is largely boring, and he is so irrelevant and removed to most of the happenings in the second that it is a real slog until the third act when Smaug shows up. Freeman deserved better than the movies he got, he was the perfect Bilbo.
That's not saying much.

Though he did do a phenomenal job.
Cause it’s over and you get to go home and forget the movie
Eventually in the comics they realise this, and Superman stops facing physical challenges and they move over to more emotional/moral dilemmas. 
[deleted]
I got the impression he only got that fast in response to a threat.

Edit: I seem to remember reading that one of Superman's writers said he's always as strong as he needs to be and that's how I view his power levels.
~~*indignant beep*~~

*Atari noises*
In legends he didn't die, but that's a different story. 😐
Oh damn. I never thought of that. I wonder if Anakin knows his backstory?
Never tell me the odds.
It's made with bits of real panther, so you know it's good
That doesn’t make sense.
Sooooooooy
Yo, bring it on down
Season 4 E7-E22 is perfect. You're just getting to the best parts 
Had to be be; someone else might have gotten it wrong. 
It might be stupid of me but of all the RPGs with a moral system I've played, even with multiple playthroughs I've never played an outright evil character.  I just can't bring myself into hurting innocent people albeit fake ones in a video game
Yep
I was about to make this point.

I think all SW movies will continue some trends (bad feeling in core movies, call back in side movies), 3PO and R2 in every movie, etc, and there isn't anything wrong with them. Just like Stan Lee in MCU.
The best little thing about Dredd is that he refused to remove the helmet because the helmet is too essential to the character.
Urban is actually a huge geek and fan of the stuff he acts in. 
I feel like the only one who fricken *loved* Doom. The characters were fun, the plot was solid, the action was great (especially the FPS scene). So what if it wasn't exactly like the video game? If i wanted to watch the video game for 2 hours, I'd play the video game. Getting real sick of the "it wasn't just like the video game, therefore it sucked" argument. Same way with Super Mario Bros - another fun, well-made film imo.

(not ranting at you btw, just in general lol)
And let's not forget his fantastic turn as Eomer. 
Martin Freeman is a good actor, though.  As much as i liked Alden in Hail, Caesar, that was more of a caricature than a character.  I have no idea if he can act realistically.
Martin freeman is great with his delivery and mannerisms in all the roles i've seen him in, now that i think of it.
Superman only works well when you give him problems he can't punch really hard.
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 - just keep going man.

The Umbara arc is the best by far.
Fun fact: about 5% of Mass Effect players shoot Mordin and are therefore irredeemable as people.
Fuck man Ididnt need this tonight.
I thought we were in trouble there for a second but it's fine, we're fine. 
Really liked Urban and his body of work before I found that out, instantly decided I’d watch *anything* he signed on for after I heard that little fact. 
He's a Gary Stu that is used really well in many stories.    
In some Justice League stories they just have him juggle mountains or fight the Sun, or something equally ridiculous like that
One Punch Man comes to mind
Definitely made me care about the clones during the umbaran arc.  Hated that jedi so much.
