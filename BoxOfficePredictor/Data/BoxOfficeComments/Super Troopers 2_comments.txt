Did Farva edit the trailer? The only time the Rookie actually speaks you can't hear him and then he gets hit with a puck.
I'm convinced they chose Canada purely for the liter cola joke. But it looks like it *might* work.
Wow...Sloan. Nice.
Wife’s birthday is April 20th, told her I was taking her on a special premiere for her 30th this year. She’s going to absolutely murder me when she realizes it’s this movie.
I had no idea they were going full Canadian. I call maple syrup subplot.
Brian Cox hasn't aged a day.
Honestly did not expect a Luc Robitaille reference. 
Hell yeah! Really excited for this and hope that Broken Lizard does more movies again after this. 
Please be good
worth the price of admission just for that mountie pullover.
I supported this on indiegogo, but always expected it to be just an OK sequel. Was going to watch it and enjoy it no matter what, but I am actually surprised I laughed during most of that trailer. Can't wait to see it.
[deleted]
I'm cautiously optimistic this will live up to the hype. The jokes were funny with hardly any throwbacks (and the ones that were were funny) and the story seems original and interesting.

~~And Steve Lemme and Jay Chandrasekhar do surprisingly good French accents.~~ Since so many French Canadians are telling me I'm wrong, let me phrase it this way: Steve and Jay (more Steve really) have very similar accents to my French professor (who is from France). I realize French Canadians' accents sound different; I am just impressed the two can pull off a *French* accent so well.
Alright, I had low expectations but that was really good. Farva doing the pledge of allegiance fucking lol
Rob Lowe and Sloan? In. 
The jokes they included mostly made me chuckle, but I have a feeling that the funniest material will stay unspoiled, which makes me really happy.  Can't wait to see the pre-screening!
Wow...better than I expected. Mostly original jokes and a plot that might work for great joke material. Plus some stars came on board. I love Rob Lowe. *literally* a God 
I know comedy sequels normally suck, but Super Troopers + Beerfest's nationality-based style of comedy? Sign me up
Super Troopers 1 [trailer for comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-9D2qUHN-E)
I demand [Philippe Brenninkmeyer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0s0czlJ4xA) in this. Mildly NSFW.

Edit: I feel like noting that Philippe Brenninkmeyer is the German guy, not the woman.
Do you want a liter of Cola?
[deleted]
A trailer with a narrator at the start? Sweet throwback

Also the literacola gag was the right way to do fan service. If they do a bunch of rehashes that are lazy I'm not going to be happy
Was that Nicole Kidman?
Mother of God.
The French sounding gibberish at the end haha. “Feather duster crossaint les miserable fart catcher something something Fran Tarkenton”
Did I catch a Luc Robitiallie in there at the end?? Followed by a Fran Tarkenton??
Totally getting a litre of cola to watch this!
Damn this looks stupid...cannot wait. 
Holy shit, it's [Will Sasso.](https://youtu.be/kPin_aXY1JM) 
Would you guys be interested in an AMA with Farva? I grew up in his hometown and date his cousin. Always wanted to ask him to do one but was never sure how much reddit liked him.
Holy hell that looks funny as shit.  Damn please don't let me down.
What's the song?
As a Canadian... I'm fuckin pumped for this movie, eh?
Man, I thought the first one looked stupid when I first saw the trailer and it ended up being one of my all time favorite comedies. This looks funny, so does that mean it’s going to blow me away? 

4/20 is shaping up to be a solid day this year. Super Troopers 2 and Nintendo Labo. 
I mean in general I like the French, but I'm happy with this so far.
I can proudly say I donated towards the indiegogo program to help this movie be made. You're welcome :P
I'm always excited to see more Farva 
Goddamn it this might actually be good.
Holy shit, I'm actually happy to see Farva. lol
Here's a link to the video when the guys (and Rita) live "premiered" the trailer on Facebook with some discussion, commentary, drinking games, etc.

[https://www.facebook.com/theCHIVE/videos/10156245830146742/](https://www.facebook.com/theCHIVE/videos/10156245830146742/)
All the neigh sayers can suck it, that looks amazing 
How can you people have such low respect for the BL boys? They wouldn’t do you wrong with a shitty sequel. Quit expecting shit from these funny dudes. 
I found out tonight I have to get screened for cervical cancer, but that made me burst out laughing. Probably helps that I’m baked. And Canadian.
Any doubts I had about this not living up to the original are gone. Now let's get started on the "Club Dread" sequel!
I wonder why they chose that as the release date.
Stupid...I want to see it.
Really glad to see that (in this trailer at least) they aren't relying on recycling old jokes, light referencing is fine and was peppered into this perfectly. Hope they keep that same ratio of new jokes  to callbacks.

Just don't let it be like that hunk of garbage dumb and dumber too where every joke was "HEY REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID/DID THIS 20 YEARS AGO?!" Fuck that was painful. 
Someone popped that Ursa ultimate too quickly
Linda Carter is still Hottttttt!! (The original Wonder Woman)
Probably, rookie biotch
Seriously though Heffernan and Chandrasekhar are the ones that edit movie and have oversight on the teaser/trailer cuts.

That's the one legged guy from P90X, right?
I hope the Canadian humour is better than what we got in Yoga Hosers
If they ended with the liter of cola joke that would have sucked, but following it up with the bopping... they was the real joke. This looks good to me.
As a Canadian, I've never called it "cola".. Only called it pop.
In Canada it's a litre cola. 
although no Canadian uses 'cola', it's always 'pop' (in English)  
  
Edit: not in Montréal
They could have chosen literally any other country except Libya or Myanmar and it would still work.
She’s still smoking hot
Yo, tell Sloane I said whaddup.

Brian Cox has been 60 years-old for the last 20 years.
None of them have! How?! 
I was thinking all of the guys look good for their age.
Brian Cox is a God damned Saint! 
Same with Emmanuelle Chriqui (most known as Sloan from Entourage). She's looked 25 for the past decade. That woman is fucking divine.
Great Tim Horton's ghost
He did play in LA for a while. 
I like how he randomly shows up in a How I Met Your Mother episode, as well. 
Luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuc!
Yeah, I hope this is a revival for them!

I had so much hope the first time they broke into the mix, but wasn't too impressed besides Beer Fest...
..... still waiting for that Potfest, boys..... let's get on it!  


Perfect time to do it, politically.
When are we gonna get the Potfest we deserve.  The world is clearly ready for it!
More than that I hope it continues to foster the microfinancing of movies. I had a blast paying for this; they ran a great fundraising campaign. I would love to get to see other niche shit get made in future. The fragmentation of media financing and distribution is really the one thing this timeline has going for it.
I don't need it to be good, i just need it to not be shitty!
But you've already seen it now.
>pullover

no it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing
I kept meaning to and then forgot until like 2 days after it ended :/
Yeah as most comedy sequels go I was expecting a lot of cringey rehashed jokes but this looks hilarious. I'm ready for more Farva
I hope its not one of those where all the funny or scary stuff is in the trailer
Same here. I remember sitting on my (now ex)girlfriend's computer and signing up for the cheapest thing, which was a photocopied print of their asses. A shame they fell through on that one I think, but I updated my address from emails they've sent me and am not sure what they plan to send me, if anything.
Ooiii I vant one
> I've been wanting a mustache ride for a while ~~now~~ **meow**.

FTFY

I hope they have some healthy banter with the Mounties. There's so many opportunities there.
I was excited to see Rob Lowe!
Honestly, I laughed aloud at a few of the bits here. I'm cautiously optimistic 
That French gibberish between Steve and Jay at the end of the trailer was fucking hysterical. My wife and I were both nearly in tears!
Even if it is just ok, I will be happy. 
Worked on this film, you are correct to be optimistic. 
They have a funny France accent but to nail the Quebecois accent they should study GSP and Denis Villeneuve.
Like the German accents were “accurate” in beer fest, who cares! 
I feel the same way.  Hopefully what we saw here wasn't the best parts
Steve lemme plays a different ethnicity very well
“I pledge of allegiance to the flag...” made me lol
I'm surprised by how good this looks. As a Québecer, I'm fucking stoked that they're going to poke fun at us!

Also, "[ça plane pour moi](https://youtu.be/K6HrLN32hvw)" by Plastic Bertrand is a wicked song.
For real that chicks name just might as well be Sloan because that's what everyone calls her lol 
They say on the podcast they do that they didn't wanna put the funniest stuff in the trailer. But they also said they weren't worried because the movie is so packed with funny that it wouldn't hurt to put a bunch in the trailer.

hopefully there is a potfest teaser at the end.  

Make it a whole Lizard-verse with a teaser at the end of each movie.
Smoking the reefer
Oh great, a bar of soap
See: Trailer Park Boys, Letterkenney, FUBAR for some good Canadian Humour.

TPB is the pride of Canada.
That’s a mighty low bar you’ve set their, friend. I dunno, for me I think I’m over hearing exaggerated québécois and letterkenny accents whenever Canadians are on American tv or movies. 

I’m Canadian and am so used to hearing people just talk normally without either of those accents so it’s always kinda bugged me that those outliers are considered our identity. 

I know they’re used because it’s more interesting than just hearing someone talk normally, it’s just disappointing not seeing a more traditional depiction of a Canadian.

 I think Rob Lowe might be playing a traditional accentless Canadian or he might just suck at doing the exaggerated one everyone else is doing. 
I really would love to see another Strange Brew.
*booping*
What was the bopping about?
Canadian here too, I just call it mix.
[We have many names for pop here in the ol' Red, White & Blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_soft_drinks_in_the_United_States)
The only Canadian that ever called it something other than pop was [Kim Mitchell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXnTbmPxv5g)
Pop sounds childish to me, but Soda and pop are interchangable in my book, as they refer to carbonated drinks.

COLA however is not something that can be applied to all sodas/pops. It refers to sodas/pops made with Kola nut. See Coca Cola/Pepsi Cola. This does not include Dr. Pepper, which is not made with the kola nut.

Liter'o'cola could be correct if you are only offering coke, pepsi, or storebrand cola and feel like being needlessly specific.
Really? Cause you never think of those other two countries as having their shit together...
way, way, way, way, way, way, way, WAY too good for E
Still? She’s one of those types that will *always* be fine 
So no one is going to comment on how perfect their French is.
wow i forgot about that E/seth green drama on the show.... i need to rewatch from s01e01 
Yo E, did you tell Sloane I said "whaddup" yet?
No joke, I watch that episode like once a year. Its a tradition of mine. The ending is so good.
Make the call, E!

Yea, Super Troopers and Beerfest are great. Club Dread is decent but I actually really liked Slammin' Salmon (the movie they did during the Writer's Strike). But after that they sort of went their own ways occasionally collaborating for somethings but it's great they have a new movie coming out!
Beer Fest is a perfect movie.
If you ever worked in hospitality Slammin' Salmon was awesome.
I'm guessing releasing this on 4/20 is alluding to that movie in the future.
> But you've already seen it ~~now~~ ***meow***

FTFY
No that’s gonna be like a 5 minute scene.
Or have we?...
Its okay, I have very bad memory so I probably wont remember by the time I go watch it in theaters.
They had the campaign up for a while. That's some good procrastination. 
But the tailer just came out? How'd you forget to laugh for two days after?
I didn't see any scary stuff in the trailer don't worry
I forked up the $100 for movie posters, a mustache, a badge, and some aviators.  
It's been so long that I forgot I signed up on their indiegogo.
I'm not ashamed to admit that I was 13 when that movie came out and I jerked off to that scene. 
Hopefully it lives up to the rivalry they had with the local cops in the original.
The Broken Lizard movies are best when there's a villain. When it's just them living 'a day in the life' it doesn't pan out as well.
And I saw will sasso which I always thought he's pretty funny.
Seeing him *literally* peaked my interest.  He is a wonderful human being and an even better friend.  

I relish his appearance in this movie. 
I seriously thought I saw Bruce Willis in the angry meeting mob, sitting on the aisle.

Probably wrong, but that would be funny as hell.
i'm reluctantly hopeful myself
I'm afraid all the funny parts are in the trailer 
I need to see it written out! I couldn’t catch every reference.

Still like the show but the netflix seasons just don't feel the same.
Dude, kids in the hall is the best sketch comedy ever (that's also Canadian)
Can't leave out Kenny vs Spenny
I don't watch any of those but Corner Gas was always my favourite Canadian comedy.
Corner Gas mother fucker 
Tron funkin blow
I think South Park nailed Canadians perfectly
As someone who grew up in a place where everyone talked "stereotypically Canadian", I've always enjoyed the accents on TV, even if they're usually not super accurate and usually just weird Wisconsin accents.
That’s literally everywhere, everyone in the US thinks that everyone from Boston sounds like a Kennedy and in every movie set in Boston they have horrible accents. Just like everyone having a southern accent in anything in the south or everyone from Chicago sounding like the SNL sketch of Da Bears but they don’t. It’s just the way people make things in tv and movies if it’s set in any area with something distinguishable about it then every main character has to have that feature, especially comedies for the cheap yucks from people not from the area.
Edit: I am also from Massachusetts and I know plenty of people who don’t have it and plenty that do it depends on where they’re from in the state.
This movie is going to be fun as hell no matter what.

*Turning off further spoiler goggles
Farva being annoying.

Sloan Peterson? I see her with Ferris Bueller a lot.

I still enjoy that movie, there's nothing very special about it but still entertaining
You gotta relax your jaw and don't forget to cup the balls.
My dad drinks real Canadian maple syrup straight from the bottle. Watching that makes me sick as is. 
With you on that.  Did it once.  I also do not recommend.

You get warm and anxious.  Then everything comes up but the syrup.  It's too heavy.  You'll pass out later and wonder what you were thinking.

I've never heard of Slammin' Salmon.

Maybe I'll check it out!
Slammin salmon is very underrated 
Slammin' Salmon does great at hitting a lot of waiting tropes. I feel like I knew all the people in that movie from working in restaurants.
Well.. I mean the first one was basically all about the local PD smuggling pot into town.
Fucking Rookie
But you've already seen it chicken fucker
I'm spectacularly lazy
What about the bear?
there were some nice titties in that scene for sure
I hope it doesn't feel like a retread of just Mounties instead of local cops
As with most stories.
Idk slammin salmon is great

SCTV
The writing is insanely witty. It's not a show about smart people for dumb people like Big Bang Theory, or a show about dumb people for smart people like Arrested Development, it's just funny. It has a real Archer vibe to it, where there's tons of one liners that just build off each other. Highly recommend it to anybody. My only nitpick is that the lines come so fast sometimes that I have to watch some scenes a few times to catch everything. 
Why does one guy sound normal, and one sound and look like some kind of mountain folk?
Holy fuck that's awesome! How many seasons of that are there? And is there a way to watch it in the states?
I’ve seen this clip, but had no idea it was a full series. How do I watch this?
Uh... where can I watch more of this?
I think I'm the only American that knows the show exists. I love all 4 seasons 
Yeah, they should have ended that show on a high note. They've lost what makes the show funny, and now they're just overdoing the jokes and taking everything too over the top.
Isn't she beautiful. Scraping off the pudding with the grace of a butterfly. She rubs the pudding on her face. The prince now attempting to remove one of the princesses' arms, as is of course the tradition. The princess screaming with pain, everyone watching with anticipation -- And the arm is off! Things are back to normal here in Canada. Time honored traditions are once again -- Yes, the prince is sticking the princesses' arm up his ass. There it goes. He's really making a good go of it. What a wonderful day for Canada, and therefore, of course, the world.
As is tradition.
The top and bottom of their heads arent connected?
You're right, but I have no idea how to explain why. It's a mix of completely accurate stuff and just the most intentionally absurd shit imaginable.

Really we're just happy to be a central plot point sometimes. 
They chose the path of absurdity. You do that and you can make fun of anything. 
as I Canadian, I agree
God, the Wisconsin accent is super abused. I have friend's in Illinois and they swear I don't talk in an accent but the accent the think I should have is a Northwoods one. (BTW I have an accent family down south tells me all the time).
Hey buddy. I live in Massachusetts and I assure you that everyone does have an absurd accent. 
Agreed about Boston & Chicago. 

Rhode Island though. That's another damn country. Need someone to translate the announcements at the airport. 
[deleted]
The radio show I listen to in Detroit recently started broadcasting in Boston, and it's crazy the variance in accent. Some people sound like they have no accent but others sound exactly like a Boston stereotypical accent. 

I live across the way from Canada and even though it's subtle, I can definitely tell the difference between a Canadian and American accent. It's funnier when it's overpronounced but it's a pretty accurate mild exaggeration IMO. 
Farva being Farva
Blasted her in the face like a Jackson Pollack

For real. The cringe of the last season especially is just waaaaaay too much for me.

That scene where she's looking out her window. You know the one.
At least that dude from 100 Girls finally figured it out. Lucky bastard.
She must be on that TB12 method
yeah she was a hottie back in the day.
Fun fact, she's married to Jim Henson's (creator of The Muppets) son.
Between that and Legend as her first two movies, she should have been a megastar. Probably refused to go down on Harvey Weinstein....
Yeah. I was listening for some tunes and was disappointed.

The trick is just dipping into it for a swig or two for dessert or when you're high and have no self control. 
wouldn't that just be what you would expect though?
I looked 16 until I was 25, and 25 until I was 34. Went grey at 36 and now can easily pass for 48 when I grow my beard out. Feels bad man.

The scene with the secret ingredient. Funny as hell
Bill Paxton is with god now :(
Coconut Pete's Paella... Can anyone guess what the secret ingredient is?
I love Club Dread. I’m in the minority I know it. I just have fond memories of being 12 and seeing this for first time in theaters. 

I remember a really funny awkward interview between Kevin Pereira and Jay Chandrasekha on Attack of the Show about Beerfest but Club Dread came up. Kevin asked something along
The lines of how did that even get made and hopefully beerfest is better. Jay tried to defend Club Dread so much in it and Kevin realized it and quickly switched subjects lol
> Bill Paxton is god.


WHATEVER MOTHERFUCKER!
Oh, yea, it's a low budget movie they did outside of their studio deal during the Writer's Strike. It's a pretty funny movie. Kinda like "Waiting..." if you've ever seen that. 
If you like their general style of comedy you'll probably enjoy it.
It's actually my favourite comedy of all time. If you've ever worked in retail or hospitality, I highly recommend it!
michael clark duncan deserves an oscar for that

I expect something like a more fleshed out german party from *Beerfest*
Nope, my interest was at its highest level after seeing him.  

Peaked. 
I'm not readily gloomy about it either.

Yeah, cable Rob Lowe was Californication
She's gonna butter our bread.
Oh HELL. Give me. The goddamn soap.
A friend of the family is married to his son. Red is EXACTLY like you expect he is in person. Legit the character is him.

Right up there with Robertson screws.
If it ain't broke, you ain't tryin... 
I remember watching the Red Green show for the first time. We were all really high on LSD and couldn’t believe that it was real. Good times. 
I used to look forward to visiting my grandparents so I could watch the Red Green show on PBS there. We didn't get Red Green on North Dakota PBS.
If they don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy.
I've never even heard of this. 
I used to watch Red Green with my Dad. I still watch it. I love Red Green. I'm a man
 but I can change
 if I have to
 I guess.
Same here.
Nathan For You
Maybe before Rick Mercer left.
Strange Brew
That's even kind of the punchline in the Florida State Seminole Vesicules joke, when Wayne has to stop the guys because they just rolled right passed his joke.
Does a duck with a boner drag weeds? 
Honestly Letterkenny has the best banter I’ve ever seen on screen. 
Ontario doesn't really have any mountains, just hilly areas, so towns are always a mix of highs and lows.
As a person who grew up around there, I genuinely have no idea which one you're regarding as either.
One guy is Canadian, and the other guy is Canadian.

Lift anchor and pray for fair winds. 
Nah brah. We've even seen this shit in Mississippi. Watched it on the back of an old chifferobe we was about to bust up.

I thought the whole point was that they were making fun of how little most Americans know about Canada even though we're pretty much the same. To many Americans we're some weird group of people who live where it's mostly dark and always frozen. They just took it a step further and made everything about Canada just absolutely ridiculous - except for the arm up the ass thing, that is tradition.
When I read that it sounds just like Kennedy in my head.
lived in boston for 4 years, can confirm boston accent is real

then you've never been west of worcester
These accents do exist in Canada too.  Atlantic Canadians have some messed up accents sometimes, so it kind of fits the region as well.

Up to his shenanigans ...
That fight scene is to this day one of my favorites 
I liked it when eminem beat vince. he cried.
The movie was actually worse if you can believe it.
The finale is so feel good tho I love it 
The cream of the crop Mean Gene...

She remaind a super hottie for a long time. Still hot. 
Kermit?!

I believe you mean my song 'pinacoladaburg'

I still pronounce Penolope as Pee-nel-ope whenever come across the name 
I think you mean piñacoladaburgh
PINACOLLADABERG!
Such a great bit.
YES, GODDAMNIT! YES!!!
why doesnt it sound like that when i say it?  Meat drapes!
Kinda like Waiting in the sense they’re both based in a restaurant. 
I think it's the best one. It just seems like the most well rounded comedy they have done.
wassup noodledick?
You know what ten grand feels like in your pocket?  It feels like a third cock!
> dont get me started

Nobody can.
Yeah I loved the Germans. I just loved Beerfest period, always been bummed they didn’t do Potfest afterwards. It kind of just writes itself. 


No lol, you meant piqued mate 
Peanut buster parfait! 
Anyone...? Ok, no cream...
Bend over and grab your toes, I’m going to show you where the wild goose goes.
Mr sunshine on my god damn shoulders John denver 
That is somehow incredibly reassuring to know. Thanks, lol.
Well, if the women don’t find you handsome at least they’ll find you handy. 
Met him once at a local PBS pledge drive, had the same experience.
There was an askreddit thread along the lines of "People closely related to someone famous, what are they like?" and one guy said his uncle was Steve Smith and said the exact same thing. Dude's a real life Red Green.
If the women don't find you handsome, they should at least find you handy. 
Ya, like what the hell is up with that? Americans don't use them?
It blows my mind those aren't more internationally accepted. Easily superior screws. 
Rofl. I can imagine that it would feel totally unreal... Like you were watching someone's home movies or something.

The Jon Dore Show
Although Nathan Fielder is Candadian, I wouldn’t call NFY a “canadian show” being that it’s written and produced in USA
[The scene](https://youtu.be/dc_l9XjNYY4) for anyone who hasn't seen it.
I always feel like it's worth mentioning they had a handful of youtube skits before they got picked up for TV, most of 'em are really good.

I just realized I'm a season behind on the show. BRB.
Hands down best banter in a show
If Letterkenny has taught me anything it's that Ontario is always a mix of highs and drunks.
Really into those nautical jokes tonight, aren't we?
Ay fuck you buddy!
You mean Woosta?
The way Johnny comes out of nowhere and says "no but I do!" and punches Seth makes me jump out of my chair like I just watched a hail Mary touchdown pass. It's so epically timed.
Also, "It's the we-don't-drink-Jaeger crew" is one of my favorite lines from any show
The whole show and its movie are pure shlock, and I love every minute of it. Fuck the deniers and the haters alike.
I loved the movie
DAS BOOT DAS BOOT DAS BOOOOOOOT
MOTHER MOTHER FUCKER
YOU THINK EDDIE MONEY HAS TO PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT??
It’s actually pronounced Metdrapedes sir 
Yea, and it's one night of the interworkings of the restaurant staff. 
It's frustrating!
Oh look, there's soap in my coffee.
Hey Farva, what's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy shit on the walls and the mozzarella sticks? 


Are you saying youre going to light my country music award on fire?
He came to my high school 5 years ago to do a stand up show and afterward when I gave him a roll of ducktape to sign his signature he looked at me and smiled like he was really proud of me. I have it up on my wall still. 
Keep yer stick on the ice! 
Then I can back up that guys story. It is 100% true. 
They are available, but they are not terribly common. Those of us who know them swear by them, though.

They work too well. You don't need to constantly buy new screw drivers and swear at screws that strip while only half-way in, unlike good old Phillips heads. Robertson screws are too practical for a freedom-loving country like America.
It's pretty common when an inventor refuses to license their design and doesn't know how to run a business.


Dude, thank you. 
Fuck I loved that show, now I can't find it to watch anywhere.  Jon Dore is hilarious and I'm glad I got to see him do stand up at a local bar.
And for anyone who has, watch it again. 
And the YouTube skits came about from a Twitter that Jared Keeso and a buddy of his ran

FTFY
Yar har fiddle de de
Also the build up while he is walking from the room to the club is so tense. 
It's basically Sex in The City for men, and there ain't a damn thing wrong with that. 
The honest trailer guys nailed entourage. It was a stupid fun show
The movie was so bad. I loved it.
EDDIE MONEY DOESN'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT
do you know what 10 grand feels like in your pocket?  feels like a third cock!
Shenanigans?
I'm a man but i can change, if i have to, i guess.
I had never looked at them, just searched after seeing this thread, and holy shit I want them.

Besides that Phillips as an outcome of the design are prone to stripping, too often I see Phillips head screws that are manufactured with the inside corners cut in - to give you even less grip and make it even easier to strip. They're hot garbage.
Don't forget you can just stick them on the screwdriver with no worries of them falling off.
American here. Have adopted Robertson screws. Next up: the metric system. 
I'm a real shit disturber. I'll disturb your shit all night
The entire plot line of him accidentally seducing Ken is too fucking funny. Johnny's lack of self-awareness is hilarious. "California almonds Ken" "Memory like an elephant" "I don't want those hands touching anyone else". Too many perfect lines to count. Probably the best episode of Entourage along with "One Day in the Valley"
“Do yo chain hang low” 
I feel like they swung to the hater side, but I admit the show isn't for everyone.
My dad worked for PL Robertson in Milton. He'd get a kick out of this discussion. 
Sort your date format out while you're at it. 
Agreed. Looking back on that series that might be the only episode I can recall years later as being really good.
I like it for Ari Gold's dialogue
