The real story is pretty funny too

>One February day in the mid-1990s, Mr. Tombari and his wife, then living in California, got a knock on the door from a friend. "Hey, Joe, you've got to check this out. You wouldn't believe what I just bought," he said, as he led the two out to his car.
What they didn't know was Sean Raftis, who was "It," had flown in from Seattle and was folded in the trunk of the Honda Accord. When the trunk was opened he leapt out and tagged Mr. Tombari, whose wife was so startled she fell backward off the curb and tore a ligament in her knee.
"I still feel bad about it," says Father Raftis, who is now a priest in Montana. "But I got Joe."

Jake Johnson AND Hannibal Buress!!
I like this ensemble cast, this could be as funny as Game Night. 
This actually looks pretty fun, I hope that the movie does a good job building up their relationships and if it does it looks like it could be a good one!
I'm more interested in the 'true story' part than the actual film.

Is there a link to the story?
Hannibal Burress needs to become a comedy star. He’s so god damn funny. My favourite thing about Homecoming. He really nailed that teacher’s apathy.
This looks actually...decent?
I am only here for the hawkeye Jokes
I gotta say, I laughed throughout most of that trailer. I'm excited! With this and Game Night, seems to be a good year for game-related comedy films featuring adult friends and their traditions
Well, I went in thinking this would be incredibly stupid, but I actually want to go see this now. Also, Hawkeye
So this is how Hawkeye transitions into Ronin
“This is our gangbang”
Didn’t Jeremy Renner break both his arms on this movie? I think I read that somewhere.
This has a lot of potential. Reminds me of The Night Before.
I've heard very little about this movie before watching the trailer.

But as dumb as it might seem....it actually looks pretty good to me.
Reminds me of [this scene](https://youtu.be/Ct6EuC1W1gE) from Bojack Horseman. 
Everyone is asking where he hell is hawkeye in the infinity war trailer and now we get him in a trailer... But the wrong one﻿
This actually seems pretty funny. Hannibal was excellent as always.
I loved the Wall Street Journal article this is based on. Fun read. 

"'You're like a deer or elk in hunting season,' says Joe Tombari, a high-school teacher in Spokane, who sometimes locks the door of his classroom during off-periods and checks under his car before he gets near it."

I predict this will cause a craze of tag being played by grown men for about two weeks

...except for that one friend who doesn't know when a joke is over and tries to keep it going for years.
The editing of the trailer is on point.

"Time is a construct."

HANNIBAL BURESS TRUE DETECTIVE S3 CONFIRMED!
I really don’t care how stupid it is - this looks like a fun movie. 
$10 Jeremy Renner dies in the movie 
This looks fun
It looks original but it feels like a hangover clone
I lost it at the end line.
Not a remake of [this movie called TAG](https://youtu.be/HzcGkGuSs0U).
that hwas funny
I'll check this out because I'm hoping John Hamm gets to do some comedy/slapstick. He's such a natural.
So this is what Jeremy Renner was doing instead of Avengers.
This looks funny!  Usually don't say that about comedy trailers
Calling it now. The end is they realize he was never their friend and he wasnt there for any of the good stuff growing up.

Ultimately bringing them closer
"So this is it? You are gonna make your own avengers." - Tony Stark
How about a spin-off movie where all the avengers play tag? I'll pay to watch this.
Will see this for Jake Johnson's character alone
I want the remixed MC hammer song 
So that's where he went. 
I thought TAG may have been an acronym but it really is tag, as in the game.

This could be really funny if done right.  
This looks really good actually, I'm quite surprised.  I remember when it was supposed to be a Will Ferrell film.
I'm good friends with the writer/producer Mark Steilen. So happy for him! Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy!
The writer on this movie is the same guy who wrote and directed Waiting... it doesn't seem like he's done anything notable ever since. Wonder what happened to him.
Biggest news here is Hannibal has gone primetime
I am *so* happy that this is actually a movie about the game. I'm so watching this. Also, Edge, Christian, and Shane McMahon would ***love*** this movie. 
Well, there's Hakweye, having a new family and playing TAG.
Wow, coming out on June 15th, deep in the (already crowded) summer movie season.

That's a bold move, Cotton. Let's see if this pays off for them.
["In a world of people running away, one man is IT..."](https://youtu.be/Ct6EuC1W1gE?t=57)
Looks like we know what Hawkeye is doing, now. 

Unfortunately Annabelle Wallis seems like she's going to be wasted yet again.

On the other hand, Nice to see Hannibal  more. 
The watch bit was hilarious. Time is a construct hahaha
I found Hawkeye!
Ah so this is what Hawkeyes been doing
Hawkeye can't be tagged
Tell r/MarvelStudios we found Hawkeye!
You had me at Isla Fisher 
I found Hawkeye!!
True story+a black guy


This is a ridiculously simple yet brilliant idea for a movie, there's so much scope for hilarity here.
This looks like this could be a really funny movie
Made me laugh.  
This looks fucking horrible.
This looks very bad
10 bucks says this movie opens with a group of kids on the playground playing tag with one of them not getting tagged insert stupid dialogue about how we should always play tag or something like that then title card: 30 years later...
Looks awful.
Dude what a cast
A few scenes were filmed at my go-to bar in Georgia and I've been waiting for the trailer to come out for a few months now. Looks like it was worth the night of having to drink down the street.
And now we know why he isn't on the poster.
Must be some rules instead of just regular tagging. Since otherwise certain people would need to just not get to hang out with them anymore lol.
Been a while since ive seen a comedy in the theater but i love this cast i have a feeling this will kill 
This looks more like a fake snl trailer than a real movie, right?
If this film gets a lot of attention, these poor actors are going to get constantly, unwittingly, assaulted by super fans forcing games of unwanted tag on them.
*slaps the shit out of actors back* “oh man! My favorite line you said was asleep;lakfjjsad!!!!”
This looks fantastic! Seems like it has the potential to be really heartwarming.
Thanks I needed that after the Mr. Rogers trailer. 
This looks... actually pretty great
The "time is a construct" joke was pretty good lol
This looks fun. I'll enjoy it on Netflix.
IMO, they should have written the movie so that they always play tag in **June** instead of May. That way it would coincide with the movie's release date.
Good trailer. Good marketing. I might check this out. I hope it has some heart to it like The 40 Year Old Version. You got to know the characters and at the end they realize that what they have been doing to him isn't really right. 
Dope movie
If you've never been tagged are you really playing tag? Like then you don't get to tag anyone else right?
I'm legitimately excited for this. Looks better than every comedy sequel and most original comedies, so sign me up!
I could have sworn this story was posted on Reddit.
I remember the actual reddit thread about this guess they saw it from a news story and made it into a script.
Can you imagine if they were playing freeze tag
My friends' apartment is in this trailer!
This actually looks really funny! Great cast too!
For a moment I thought this was going to be a religious movie on the Transcendental Argument for the existence of God(TAG).
A story about the watchmakers ?
Ive been wait for this movie for 5 years. But when i originally read about it Will Ferrell and Jack Black was attached to it.
Lol wtf
r/Spokane!! This started at Gonzaga University. 
Damn...a comedy from Hollywood that might actually be good? I feel like I'm in the twilight zone.
Cast looks great. 

Should be a solid comedy
Found Hawkeye!
Could be interesting or forgettable
Ronin.
In that still I can't tell if this is Jeremy Renner or Rob Schneider
I was like: man i'm gonna be so disappointed when it's not about the game 'tag'  
after trailer: ohhhhdaaaamn this is awesome
In my headcannon this is the Bourne Legacy sequel we were promised.
This looks really good actually
Glad to see Mr. Peanut butter getting a use out of the movie rights he bought
Well, we found out what Hawkeye's been doing during Infinity War.
This movie had me as soon as they said "based on a true story."  Looks like it could very well become one of my favorite comedies.  Fingers crossed.
I really hope El Chupacabra dubs Jon Hamm's lines in the Spanish release of this
Just saw the ad for the first time on TV.

Me: "Hey, that looks pretty fun! I might go see it!" *starring...Ed Helms* Oh. Nope, never mind.
I wanted to like Tag because I’m a sucker for nostalgic sentiments but the movie never connected with me emotionally. It just wasn’t enough. [This](https://thefilmguys.blog/reviews/augusts-reviews/tag-2018/) sums it up best.
Movie get's you emotionally invested when you realize why they play the ending with them all playing tag will dayum near have you in tears, alot deeper than i though it would be kinda Amazing makes you wanna reconnect with all your friends!
Hollywood has officially  run out of ideas..I'm getting pissed off at them now. Nobody wants to fucking see a movie about a fucking childrens playground game..be fucking creative for fucking once, Hollywood. FUCK
I found Hawkeye!....guys...?
[removed]
You had me at Isla Fisher talking about gangbangs
Has Ed Helms made a good movie ever?  
This is why he is not in Infinity War, he is busy playing Tag.
Ok, this looks bad. 
Wow a non-sequel that isn't a comic book movie. Nice.
Can we just start paying actors to shit on our faces? Just cut out the middle man.
It’s good to see Hawkeye in a trailer.
So why is Hawkeye getting married to the reporter from Brown?

edit:also from checking the cast list on imdb TIL Brian Dennehy is still alive.
After watching game night I thought it would be the funniest movie I'd see in awhile, I might be wrong!
This spoils Avengers Infinity War. This takes place after the war so we know Hawkeye does not die﻿


Looks like pure GARBAGE 
This looks pretty dumb. But Hannibal so. 



Bitch. 
That makes it sound like the guy became a priest as penance, lol

Mr. T was my teacher.  Crazy that they actually made this into a movie.
Oh god I remember this!!!!!
Nick Miller is a stone cold killer!
I want to see this just for Jake. He really needs to be in more things.
AND NARD DOG AND THE HAMMAN!
This movie must have been filmed like 3-4 years ago, because Hannibal hasn't needed glasses since early 2015.
Was Game Night worth checking out?
I always like movies along the lines of "successful adults use all their resources to act like children". I think my appreciation for it started with The Hangover. Recently Game Night was really fantastic. Just a fun kind of movie.

Also I've been waiting for Hamm to do more comedy. Was excited when he was cast in Baby Driver but he wasn't actually a comedic part of that movie. He's so good at it.
I read about this story several years ago when I was at uni. So I wrote up an outline for my mates and we played it for a week across our two campuses.

Was amusing hearing about people trying to keep a good view of everyone around them at all times while waiting for classes/eating lunch etc and the random tags.
Reminds me of Without a Paddle. 
Reminds me of SporkWarz
Here's an [article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-epic-game-of-tag/).
It's not as insane as the movie will likely be.

A group of 10 guys continue a game of tag in the month of February. The game has been going on for years.
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/an-epic-game-of-tag/
Espn actually did a short on these guys. They are from Spokane Washington and it sounds like a lot of these situations are real
and then he sent someone else to the Homecoming premiere pretending to be him and Sony/Marvel didn't find it near as funny as everyone else.  
He is a star he has [his own show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDD2NesiHdE)
"Pretty sure this guy is a war criminal now, but whatever"
Snail Down
Time is a construct.
His deadpan delivery just works so well. I can't stop laughing with that dude.
He's mixed for me. His stand up and stuff are hit or miss to me, but he usually nails his acting roles. He is a highlight in an already hilarious Broad City, for instance. 
Anyone else ever have issues understanding him though? I've seen him in a few things, and he's one of those guys I have to suddenly pay a lot more attention to when they're speaking just so I catch everything. He has a bit of a mumble going I think.
His stand up is some of the best out right now. 
i mean he's in everything now
who was he in homecoming again? 
Okay, don't yell at me, but which character was he in Homecoming again? Damn, I saw it in theaters and now I'm drawing a blank. Maybe I need more coffee
I'll agree but only because I like him way more in movie roles. I just can't stand his delivery normally but as part of a movie scene, I love it. Also his part at the Justin Bieber roast was gold.
A new trend in comedy films perhaps. Something like what John Wick did to action films. 
They will screw it up somehow. The wedding scene? If you know the game is in May, why make the wedding in may. And why take a running start when you could just walk up.and tag him. If they stuck to the true story I bet it would be good. But they won't. They will completely overblow it, throw in a car chase that will be "hilarious" even though it more likely could end in death and let's say, a fall from a 20 story balcony into magical pond or pool or fountain that miraculously prevent injuries. 
He runs up to Thanos, touches the infinity gauntlet "You're it" Thanos is distracted while Hawkeye runs off with the gauntlet.
well at least we know what he's doing while the rest of the Avengers are facing off against Thanos
All jokes aside, isn't this the movie he broke his arm?
:(
Wanna hear a good Hawkeye joke? Hawkeye...
MC Hammer intensifies. 
and he married Christine Everhart before that. 
I will pay to watch that crossover
Like the DeNiro movie?
What is the story here? Is this just a "we wish Renner had been cast as Ronin from the beginning," or does Hawkeye actually become Ronin in some universe?
Isla Fisher is a top 5 hottie, been in love since Wedding Crashers. 
beautifully put
[That actually happened.](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/jeremy-renner.jpg) I know Avengers Infinity War is mostly green screen but it's funny how none of the +20 actors/actresses were injured as opposed to Renner who was hurt shooting a comedy movie.

https://variety.com/2017/film/spotlight/jeremy-renner-broke-his-arms-stunt-avengers-infinity-war-1202489347/
Broke *both* his arms, you say?
He did break an arm. Source: wife worked on the film.
I was just about to ask that lol. Saw a interview where he still had both casts on but didn’t really get into how he broke them. Anyone know what happen?!
Just as a fun fact, the guy voicing the accountant is Jake Johnson, who is also in this Tag movie.
Wow, it even had the bagel to the face part
This all seems like appropriate business to me.
Just watched this episode last night. So happy I gave this show a chance, it’s great.
Wow! I totally forgot about that.
They really are on the next level with their references and puns. 
We all knew the Hawkeye origin story was going to be quirky.
I just watched that movie over the weekend. What a trip of a movie that was.
He did Avengers instead of the latest Mission Impossible. 
Called it
Hawkeye's revenge
I loved that film, me and a friend did all kinds of weird penis showing games for ages.. Then we grew up.

He was hilarious in Jurassic World.
Digging for Fire is an all-time fave Nick Miller performance
Not everyone wearing glasses in a movie needs glasses
It is a funny movie for me but I think it is not necessary to watch it in a movie theater. 

But if you like comedy movies and like the audience reactions, I think you should see this in a movie theater.
I enjoyed it quite a bit, it's the same writer/director as Horrible Bosses and had a similar fun, free-flowing feel 
I thought game night was pretty darn good.  Worth watching, but a theater won't really add much to the experience.
best comedy ive seen in theaters since hangover 1, step bros, suuperbad
I laughed from beginning to end. It's not a masterpiece but it's a great fun evening. You don't have to watch in theatres but watching with an engaged audience enhances the film.
The jokes were on point and the general production values felt strong. 
Absolutely! It’s genuinely funny and it’s shot well. Also has a good synthwave type score. 
I didn’t like it as much as I wanted to. Got some pedigree but parts of it really fell flat and I was left disappointed. Jesse Plemons is the best part of that one. 
It has Rachel McAdams in it & it's funny. Definitely worth it.
My wife and I laughed our asses off. I think a lot of the jokes land better if you're married, but that's me. 

Jason Bateman is always a good time, and Rachel McAdams is a treat (visually and comedically) 
Lots of people seem to really like it. I'd say it's more of a Netflix film, but the general consensus liked it more than I did.
Definitely worth watching, maybe not in the theater if you don't have moviepass or something. But it's a fun time. I was laughing pretty hard a couple times, and I'm kind of a tough crowd x(
Jon Hamm has been in a lot of comedy and he is very, very good at it (the Wet Hot prequel, 30 rock, parks and rec, unbreakable kimmie schmidt, comedy bang bang, Children's Hospital).
How did you like Grownups?
I loved game night! It was hilarious
I would enjoy more Hamm as a villain. 
His what the fuck facial expression is perhaps the best I’ve ever seen.
His Between Two Ferns appearances are legendary
>I always like movies along the lines of "successful adults use all their resources to act like children".  

Any other movies like this? Really enjoyed Game Night, although it would’ve been even better if there were more people in my theatre. 
This looks more like The Hangover than it does Game Night. Which is a good thing because Game Night was awful. 

It was entirely forgettable, predictable, and you could honestly watch Date Night from like a decade ago and get the same out of it.
i wish i had friends. 
Why isn't the movie called Tag Brothers like in the article? That's such a better name imo.
> It's not as insane as the movie will likely be.

Considering one dressed as a vagrant, another dressed as a granny, one got tagged at a funeral and they play with a priest... it seems kind of insane.  

Maybe not movie level but still pretty crazy.
Well that sounds exactly like the movie only they chose May I think. 
[deleted]
That happened? That's hilarious wtf
Sooooo...bitches be shopping. 
HANNIBAL BUSTING THROUGH
Hannibal's going to Japan!
They cancelled it after a couple of episodes
B I R D  U P!
"I can't inflict upon a dog the crazy life of a dentist!"
imma hop on this shuttlebus i'll see u later 
pretty funny in his small role in blockers 
oh wow, i love every one of his stand ups.  I thought they were all great
Funny I feel the opposite. I love his stand up and writing, but he isn't ever going to be a great comedic actor. He is really just hannibal, which is great in a lot of roles, but never really going to be a breakout lead. 
He can be very hard to follow.  It's probably why Live in Chicago is one of his better sets; because he projects more in that, than he does in most things.
The Gym teacher who is in like 2 scenes (he introduces the Captain America fitness challenge video)
Gym teacher I think 
Making them good?
not sure what you mean by trend? there's been comedy films coming out for years..?
I wish I could give you gold, but I am broke.
Is he in this movie? I feel like he has to be at some point. Same with Samuel Jackson. 
Yes. [Variety source article](http://variety.com/2017/film/spotlight/jeremy-renner-broke-his-arms-stunt-avengers-infinity-war-1202489347/)
Username checks out 
Mac hammer
I understood that reference.
Happens in next Avengers , trust fam
Ya, apparently he became it in the comics after Civil War. So makes sense. Also...the were set photos of him and he was in similar costume to Ronin. Id say he comes back towards the end of Infinity War and becomes a big part of the second movie. 
What's Jeremy Renner's mom look like?
Yes, and one very badly
We got a big shot over here!
I recall this only being season 1. Just wait, you have no idea. My personal favorite is season 2 but seasons 2-4 each far exceed season 1.
Saaaaaddest song in the wooooorld.
I'm not convinced I know how to read, I've just memorized a lot of words.
Fake news. Nothing about that movie was hilarious.
They're his glasses that he wore in previous comedy specials and on the Eric Andre Show. 
If it was any other comedy I’d agree, but Game Night has a production quality unseen in most comedies. Lots of really interesting camera angles and a killer synthwave soundtrack from Cliff Martinez. I’m actually glad I saw it in the cinema.
> But if you like comedy movies and like the audience reactions

Interestingly legit reason to see comedies in the theater.
Every movie is worth seeing in a theater. 
I went with someone to see Game Night and we were the only ones in the theater. For once that actually bummed me out. Comedies (good ones) are great with an audience
it should have been on netflix, hope they put it on there eventually
> It is a funny movie for me but I think it is not necessary to watch it in a movie theater. 

So a good movie that shouldn't be encouraged ?
I personally think he's the next Leslie Nielsen.  Handsome, straight laced dramatic actor who transitions to comedies.
He even shows up in Toast of London and that episode was fucking hilarious.
dont forget the greatest event in television history
A Young Doctor's Notebook is pretty funny at moments. Good show.
He was on a Christmas episode of Richard Ayoade's Travel Man. That was very funny. 
Bridesmaids (smaller role, I guess)
I think he’s great in his dramatic roles in Mad Men and Black Mirror, but I couldn’t disagree more about his performance in comedies. He just seems very stiff and his delivery never lands for me. That black comedy he did with Daniel Radcliffe lands somewhere in between, since he isn’t, for the most part, delivering punchlines or acting the goof. 
[yes](#spoiler)
wish I had friends that stuck around for that long :/
I had friends once. Once.
I’ll be your friend.
not imo
None of that is too out there. They do get into some lowrent hijinks, but the movie literally has Ed Helms trying to tackle Jeremy Renner during his vows. Compared to the kung fu fuckery and building scaling, dressing up as a hobo and camping where they're walking is relatively tame.
One dude dressed as a hobo, another as an old lady. Aparently the tag at a funeral actually happened. Maybe this movie is exactly as crazy as it was in real life.
In the article I just read about it, it said one guy hid in the trunk of another guys car waiting to tag him. Another guy waited in the parking garage at the other guys work for him to walk by. These guys are very invested. 
I think this is actually a transcript of a TV segment.
An epic game of tag
He lives somewhere other than LA (Chicago I think) and didn't want to travel to the premier. He posted on twitter asking if there was anybody who looked like him who wanted his tickets. Some guy who didn't look like him at all ended up going and there are pictures of him walking the red carpet listing him as Hannibal Burress.

Later on he said in an interview somewhere that Sony and Marvel were pissed at him and he doesn't expect to be in any more Spidey movies because of it. 

Which is a shame, the whole thing was hilarious. 
http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/28/hannibal-burress-sends-imposter-spider-man-homecoming-premiere/
*applause*
not talking about that garbage show
Yeah, I agree. He doesn't really act at all. It's generally funny, but I prefer when hes doing the work. 
"Pretty sure this guy is a war criminal now but whatever"
Yeah. Most of action and comedy flicks don’t really come under ‘good’. 
Yeah but do you remember when every other comedy was a Scary Movie clone? There are definitely degrees of quality, and better/worse trends within the genre.
*but this generation is terrible!!*
I mean ‘good’ comedy films. It’s very rare for mainstream comedy movies to be anything more than passable. But recently we’ve had some decent ones like Jumanji and Game Night. 
There’s always Silver. 
Someone get this man a gold
Renner is definitely in the movie, maybe just has like 10 minutes max screen time. Jackson however, I don’t think is. Although who knows he could surprise us all and show up for a quick 30 second cameo
There are pictures of him on set dressed as someone called Ronin. Don’t know marvel well but it looks cool 
I'm pretty sure he's being kept out of the trailers to preserve the story details and surprises of the film. He's a founding member of the Avengers, and we haven't started to cycle people out yet...
lol he broke his arm playing tag
"Mom, I broke both my arms...."
pls explain
That would be sick!!!
[Here ya go.](https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2Frenner-240.jpg%3Fw%3D240&w=700&q=85) 
Noooooo, stop right there. Say nothing more
I mean, no big deal, I was just excited about possibly getting to meet Andy Bernard... but no dice :/
Noo this is like episode 4 of season 2, but definitely the second season.... that’s the thing I started watching it, didn’t love season 1 so I stopped. Then I kept seeing on here how amazing it got so I started again, so happy for reddit and it’s truths! 
I don't believe in dinosaurs. I've seen the science, I just don't buy it.
Fucking preach!
Every shot with Jesse Plemons was expertly shot. They nailed his cringe perfectly.
hasn't cliff martinez done a bunch of cool stuff?
As someone who paid to see battlefield earth in theaters, I disagree 
I can guarantee you right now I would never want to watch Tunnel Rats in a movie theater, nor should anyone suffer that.  You'd have to schedule an oncologist directly following the showtime.  I'm sure there are others like that.
In an ideal world yes but I can't really budget more than one or two a month. 
For someone that never watched Mad Men, he basically is a comedy actor for me
Wow I just looked up young Leslie Nielsen and he was handsome as fuck.
His [SNL skit where he played James Mason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbiLanj8EuI) is just gold how straight he plays it
And Ryan Gosling has the drama/comedic timing chops to be a Gene Wilder type. 
Actually, that's a very good observation considering Nielsen spent most of his career as a dramatic actor before moving into the comedies.  I think Hamm would be a great straight man as he has gone under the radar in the comedy genre.
Now I want to see a Naked Gun movie starring Jon Hamm.
That show was fucking wacky in the best way
They stick around for as long as they can
There have been instances where real life was so outlandishly impossible sounding that movie directors ignore it because they think the audience would assume it's fantasy. Happens all the time for war movies.
He had a two scene extended cameo. The Red Carpet stunt pushed his profile way up - he probably got more press out of it than Martin Starr who was actually in a good 10 minutes+ of the film. I think he played it right.
Damn, I hope that's not the case. I love Hannibal, hopefully he returns
not in anymore Spidey movies?!? now that sucks
It's funny, because it gave the movie way more press than him showing up to it would. I mean a contract breach is a contract breach, but you'd think they'd be willing to overlook it. 
I'm in awe. That's some Eric Andre shit
I'm all for this new trend of "good" movies.
I don't think that is really true. 

If I had to make a list of 50 best comedy movies a lot of them would be action comedies (Hangover, Rush Hour, Tropic Thunder, 21 Jump Street, Hot Fuzz, Pineapple Express, The Other Guys, Mystery Men, Guardians of the Galaxy just off the top of my head)  
Or Zinc!
But doesn't Fox own Silver Surfer?
but not Quicksilver
Redditgarlic!
I agree, give me some gold.
What happened to his characters importance? He was like the tie that bonded them all together and ran the show and then...he’s just been gone for the past few movies. Since winter soldier I think? You’d think he’d have at least shown up in Civil War at some point. 
It's not listed on his imdb page. But Captain Marvel is.
>!whelp!<
😂😂😂
Hawkeye is likely "retired" but comes back as Ronin whose secret identity is unknown, allowing him to covertly help without implicating his family. 
Think of Hawkeye, now imagine him as a ninja. [That's pretty much Ronin in a nutshell.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronin_(Marvel_Comics)
I’m guessing he’s part of the rumored timeline plot part of the movie maybe? 
I broke my arm playing tag. Can confirm that it's a super lame way to break a bone. 
thanks *mom*
Eh. Worth it 
Guess I need to rewatch the series again. I'm mixing up my seasons.
meth damon is in it? sweet
I don’t think I’ve heard a Cliff Martinez soundtrack I didn’t like.
Looked up this movie, just how bad is it? Is it so bad it's worth watching for free?
Moviepass is both a blessing and a curse
He mostly plays it straight in that show, but he has some moments of the driest wit that no one else could really pull of the way he does.
He's so good as Don Draper.
Baby Driver?
I'd argue the OJ trial is kind of like that too. 
He will. Money over everything.
Honestly if the studios have a sense of humor they should bring the gym teacher character back but have the guy Hannibal sent to the premier in his place play him. That's what I would do.
Who killed Hannibal?
As long as someone expands it to video game films.
I didn’t mean action-comedy. I meant the two genres exclusively rarely do a good job at making something not trash. Stuff like Baywatch, Neighbours - basically any rock movie/any Zack Efron movie. They suck. 
Or tungsten. 
I think it’s coz SHIELD was basically dissolved in Winter Soldier and is on the down low in the TV show and to the movie characters.
He was in Civil War. He helped Scarlett Witch escape and launched ANT man on an Arrow. 
Thats cause Captain Marvel is set in the 90s and Nick is supposed to be super bros with Carol.
You dropped this )
I won't spoil anything but his first scene in the movie had me dying. 
I would rather pass a kidney stone than watch it again.  It's not bad in the "so bad it's funny" way.  It's bad in that it tries so hard to be good and it's so far from it that it's not even laughable.  You just wonder why you wasted your time on something so devoid of any value.

Edit: Additional info, directed by Uwe Boll

Also, "In a documentary for the film, Boll revealed the film really did not have a script, and instead the actors are improvising"
Not available at my local theaters sadly. 
Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce is who Don Draper reminded me of when he got into his witty ways. Knows he's the best on the floor, but whatever it's your "Client/Patient" with a dryer than swamp gin remark
Metro 2033 might make for a good film. 
Ya holy shit, what happened?  
Tomb Raider is pretty decent. I mean, not mind blowing, but I enjoyed it. I'd watch a sequel. 
Go see Tomb Raider
mmo please
If I had a nickel...
He's talking about Fury, not Hawkeye.
I'll upvote you because I totally read that comment as him talking about Hawkeye too.
I meant Nick Fury not Hawkeye - sorry. 
And he supposedly still has both eyes in the 90's.
Need some garlic?
Thanks. By using only "his" it made it confusing.
