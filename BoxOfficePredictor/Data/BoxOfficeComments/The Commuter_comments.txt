Non-Stop 2: This Time It's A Train
A great plot premise that seems to be ruined by unnecessarily over-the-top action sequences (the train derailing as if it's some Transformers movie...?). Seems like it would've fit better as a more tame thriller.
This is the kind of movie where I just want to read the plot on Wikipedia and never watch it. And I love Vera Farmigia, so that's really saying something.
I’m the only one beyond stoked for this. Jaume and Liam Neeson’s collaborations have all been really fun. 
When I first saw this, I was hoping it was Source Code 2.
Should have just called it Taken the Train. 
AKA Taken 4

I laughed out loud in the theater at this. All Liam movies are the same boring plot.
I think Jaume Collet-Serra is a fantastic and underrated director so I'm actually pretty excited for this.
Don't need another trailer, this was enough.
I know Neeson's reasons and all, but I wish he'd go back to drama or at least mix up his roles more.
"I'm done with action films" - Liam Neeson

Yeah when I saw this for Justice League, I just laughed.  They give the whole movie away right in the trailer.  Asking him whether he wants to get off the train or stay on it for the prize.  Only to show the train blowing up.  I thought Neeson stated last month he was finished with these action movies.  Hope this is the last
Was slightly interested in this until they spoiled the movie in the trailer 
"The Commuter" is propably the most boring movie title I've ever heard 
I love me some bad Liam Neeson movie January.  I actually laughed out loud in the theater when I first saw the title card at the end of the trailer. 
prob watch this cuz of moviepass
Another over the top Liam Nelson action movie...count me in. Seeing as he’s done one of these movies on a plane and train, the next movie should be a sequel to Planes Trains and Automobiles where he teams up with Steve Martin and John Candy’s replacement.
Vera Farmiga is very good at playing a person you'd hate to hate.
Oh Christ not again. 
Boats, spaceships... how many different ways can they make the same movie? I can only count 4 but who knows.
Always bloody krav-maga:ing...
this is such a copy of john wick /s
So, more like Many Stops.
I'm looking forward to *Non-Stop 3: Like 1 and 2, Except on a Rollercoaster*.
Throw in *Flightplan* and *In the Nick of Time* while your at it.
I’m sure that’s the biggest set piece in the movie and happens towards the end. 
Marry me.
But then you miss out on Liam Neeson kicking butt?
You're not the only one.
Non Stop was just okay for me, but I loved Run All Night.
That is a fact. I swear two or three years ago he made an announcement about how he was done doing action movies?
Maybe not fantastic but a capable craftsman who's doing the kind of mid budget stuff that has mostly disappeared in Hollywood.
He went back on it lol 
Next year, it's "BIKE LANE".
Where?
I saw John Wick but don’t remember the train...
Good to know! When I commented every other comment was hella negative
He pulled a Jay-Z  by retiring and unretiring because $$$.
It was this year(again?)

It lasted like 2 weeks before he unretired.

First shot is from Taken 2, not from The Commuter.

Ah ok. I thought I saw a teaser that showed fisticuffs, though.
OMG! I didn't realize it was so recent.
