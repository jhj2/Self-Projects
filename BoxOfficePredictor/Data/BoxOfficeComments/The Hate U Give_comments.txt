the book for this is very popular. It has been within like the top 3 on the ny times best seller for YA books for more than a year. In fact it only drops out of #1 when there is a big new release
I loved the audiobook, the narrator was great! Imho, its not a great piece of literature, but its an important, timely book and full of talking points about race. So the book as a whole was a 4/5 read for me. 

Regarding her trailer, her “black” life looks really colorful to me in the trailer and the private school looks fairly stiff and hospital like. And the movie has a Netflix vibe to me idk why 
It was a fantastic book, I hope the movie does it justice.
THUGLIFE
More SJW flicks. Exactly what we need more of.

I'm excited for this movie, so I hope it's good! The book made me feel so many things and I'm hoping the movie will be able to convey that. The cast is stacked, but I'm a little nervous about Amandla being able to carry this. Fingers crossed!
It looks like an interesting story, and something that will resonate with many people. The only thing that really worries me is the director, whose most remembered movie is the two hour cliche compilation known as Men of Honor. And the rest of his filmography isn't better. Also, there's that Riverdale kid who cannot act to save his life, so I don't see awards prospects for this movie.
I am whelmed. I want this to be good because the book is great and the story is relevant to our current time but this feels... lacking in some way. Amandla Stenberg is wonderful person but this is the second trailer I've seen with her (the other being the Darkest Minds) where I am worried about her acting abilities. 
Done well, this could be fantastic. Haven't read the book.
I've seen this book at the bookstore. It definitely has a catchy cover.
I mean, if you reach for something in your car while stopped by a Policeman then you're stupid.

Edit: policeman is stupid too but this is just a lazy way for the "white" policeman to kill the "black" teenager.
Yea now that the trailer's out I'm not concerned about Russell anymore looks like both Regina and him are doing amazing work here

Common as Uncle Carlos *and* Anthony Mackie as King totally blind-sided me, real different roles for each of them

I just know Issa and Algee are about to be flawless in it

My opinion hasn't changed about Amandla though -- still looks like casting her as Starr was a mistake -- might end up being an Annihilation situation where even though I want to see the secondary actors on screen the lead just makes me too scared it's gonnruin the adaptation of a beloved book 
Is equal to the Hate you AAATTTTTTEEEEE
Looks like a another teen movie.
cool more race baiting propaganda trash
If you guys like this movie...help me in joining the #replacethehate campaign. Simply replace the word "hate" with something you value like "respect" or "love." Its important and only takes a few seconds to share.
this movie is pure SJW propaganda.  its literally one false narrative after another. this is the type of shit that brain wash's people. they put known lies into a movie and wrap a story around it, that way you dont realize your being brain washed to think certain things because you think your watching a movie
I don't care, do u?
another race bait movie zzz
"Your eyes are full of hate, 41. That's good. Hate keeps a man alive. It gives him strenght."
Lol my friends sent me this knowing full well how much I despise *woke* movies and YA adaptations.


The terrible acting in this trailer literally made me join the Young Republicans of my state and shit out a maga hat.

Trump 2020 I guess....

Oh, this is gonna be a civil thread, ain't it? 
I guess you're getting downvoted because people don't understand what the title is referencing. But I gotchu.
Upvoted. And for those who don't know:

**T**he **H**ate **U** **G**ive **L**ittle **I**nfants **F**ucks **E**verybody

As far a the trailer, I'll reserve more judgement for the actual film.  The problem with social justice type movies is you're kind of not allowed to be critical of it as much as you would anything else because it deals with a serious issue but at the end of the day, from a filmmaking standpoint, the trailer doesn't really do it for me.  It seems like it might be a bit hamfisted, kind of how *Boyz N Tha Hood* is considered the after-school special and *Menace II Society*  is seen as the more raw hood plight movie of the two.
This song is referenced a lot of times in the book for those out of the know. 
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest. Til I got that THUGLIFE tatted on my chest. Tell me can ya feel me?
Shows the disconnect between the two worlds? 

Cold blue for the "white" world of the school versus warm yellow for the more comfortable world of home.
Not sure it's trying to win many awards. It's based on a YA novel and I'm guessing that's the main audience here. I'm sure a lot of my students will see it and hopefully there will be good discussions about it. 
KJ Apa can act. In Riverdale he just doesn't get good material to work with.

There was one episode in the second season where his character had to deal with something heavy and he protrayed it very well. 
Is this movie trying to win major awards? I understand it's releasing in the fall, but I still never got that impression.
George Tillman's a good director, and proved his indie chops with The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete. If it fails, it won't be because of him.
KJ is actually the only good actor in Riverdale. 
You should, the book is great! 
If you're a kid and you don't follow the instructions of a cop with extreme care you deserve to die? No. These are too high stakes for a fucking traffic stop. Yes what people have to do in these situations to have a chance of getting out alive (again, from a traffic stop...) are to follow all instructions as closely as possible. But the point is that it should not be like that. You should not be that close to death every time a police officer catches you speeding.
Or you’re just a kid? I’m sure he didn’t make the connection that an impulse grabbing of a hairbrush would lead to him getting shot. He’s like 16 or 17.
Don't know why you're getting downvoted.. You're 100% right.
Blame the victim.
What was he actually reaching for? I couldn’t tell.
What is a "woke movie"? I have this phrase a few times recently and I thought woke meant great. But I think that is wrong.

Also

That is fucking funny
Imagine getting mad about a movie being made about something topical.

Imagine getting mad about POC representation.

I agree that other POC and queer folk need representation. But black people being represented doesn't take away from any other marginalized group.
What are the other ones? I'd love to watch them.
uncalled for, hip hop is dope

EDIT: Also, damn. One of those songs is Keep Ya Head Up by Tupac. Show some respect for the classics
Gonna need multiple bags of popcorn for this one. 
Word, its not surprising even when Pac was alive very few people, even so called fans, really heard what Pac was saying or was on the level with the meaning behind most everything he said.

Truly auteurism at its finest
The release date for this is October 19, right in the part of awards season where the prospects are heating up. Usually, YA movie adaptations trying to make a quick buck release in March, June or August.
If you are stopped, you are almost never close to death unless you pull a gun or do some dB shit. If you think you are about to get shoot during a traffic stop you are delusional.
"stakes are too high for a traffic stop" you realize every traffic stop can be vastly different right? 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy1qbLjkJnY

Its just a traffic stop.
Read my other comments.
Because it shouldn't be like that. Your life should not be at risk every time you come into contact with the police.
Yeah. If it was not the characters fault at all it would be you more sympathetic as they were killed for no reason but he put himself in danger by reaching inside of his car whilst the policemen walked away.

But these fuckers on  this forum are impressed by movies like National Treasure so what do you expect.
Hairbrush. It may be handled differently in the film but it looks like his fault.
what makes it funnier is that I'm *was* a Mexican national but now a white man from Kansas
No worries he's probably just another chubby white boy on the internet that's pissed about never having sex or something.
Straight Outta Compton touched on this, and is a dope movie 
I believe Crash won an Oscar.
Pac would hate and denounce redditors. 
Overdone, perhaps. But I'm glad that there was at least a choice to attempt to utilize visual storytelling in that way to begin with. 
Are you actually suggesting *The Hate U Give* is going to get an awards bunch?

There's no chance. The release date is coincidental. 


So what happened to Philando Castille?
The life of the officer shouldn’t have to be at risk every time they approach someone either. It just so happens that if a criminal doesn’t want to be caught for something more sinister, or rather punished more severely for having a record.. they may take drastic measures to escape an officer.
 
Cops die too.

They place themselves at risk everyday, and it’s people who don’t understand that who believe they can get away with preforming any unnatural action, or drawing any object from their vehicles/pockets are increasing their risk.
 
Officers aren’t mind readers. People honestly make it seem like they’d rather the officer take the risk and end up dead for the chance that some dork is just picking up a hairbrush.
 
Why are you worried about your hair while you’re under inspection by an officer of the law?


I am absolutely sick of this white vs. black bullshit.

I couldn’t watch this film, or likely even read the book. It’s hate fuel, and is not about awareness as much as it is about money. They know what people will pay to see.
 
Drama at it’s peak.
One of the questions I was left with after the book was that this shouldn't be normal and a traffic stop should not be treated as a deadly situation. Putting yourself in danger by reaching for something after being pulled over is such a foreign concept to me - as someone who lives in the UK - and I think this is one of the points the book (and the film) tries to make
You shouldn't be killed for reaching for something in your car. Is it dumb? Sure. But it shouldn't result in your literal death.
The point is that a traffic stop shouldn't be a hop and a skip away from being gunned down by an officer who is supposed to protect you. Tell me you honestly are okay with that. Imagine every time your taillight is out or you ran a stop sign that you then have to be extremely careful to follow every instruction to the letter or get killed. These are not the correct stakes for a fucking traffic stop. 
No, it's the fault of a police force trained to kill at a a moment's notice. This only happens in America. 
Seems like a hypocritical, even racist thing for you to say, my dude.
And had all of those "other" minorites he's complaining he never sees. Didn't stop the complaining back then either. It's almost as if people will complain regardless.
[deleted]
Didn't stuff like Maze Runner and Hunger Games also come out in the fall?
I know im late but this is true, and this movie is just reinforcing the racism stereotype and casuing more hate/drama. How are we planing on fixing issues if movies like this are coming out that makes it seems like everyone that gets shot was innocent. 

what if he's reaching for a gun
A traffic stop is not a hop and a skip away from being shot, this film is blatantly anti- police and fear mongering. If you think real life is always luke that than you are delusional 
Yeah, because all Americans are fucking lunatics.
i mean- that's exactly how i picture those who complain that Hollywood pushes diversity too much.
There's a reason for the orange/blue. It's the boundary between light and day, cold and warmth. It's used all the time because it's effective, and reflected in nature.
Yes. And, like, Thor: Ragnarok... Kingsman: The Golden Circle... The Justice League... 
It's a traffic stop. That's a completely unreasonable assumption to make that honestly would not be made unless the cop had reasons to be nervous... like racist assumptions
That was actually discussed in the book. (He was reaching for a hairbrush.)
Um, no. No they're not. The majority of their police force is utterly insane though.
While you wouldn't be wrong the majority of the time, it's also true that this is pretty race-baitey. Not only that the diversity push is pretty disproportionate to our countries population. Not that we shouldn't have diversity and all that fun stuff.
If you asked 99 percent of cops I would garentee they would react the same on a traffic stop no matter the race. Belive it or not race usually isn't a issue
Race is not an issue. I was in Texas going to a swimming meet when my coach got caught speeding with an official school vehicle. He is an older fellow and said "Let me show you how we handled this in the old days" He walks out of the van with his hands straight up in the air. The cop immediately reaches for his weapon and tells him to get back in the vehicle. My coach is a nice old bald white man, and this was in broad daylight. These are not racist assumptions these are what they should do to protect there lives.
Man takew a job, risking his life for the safety of the public... he go catches a speeder after a few moments before, someone called in for a party(with quite probably drugs)... he stops the speeder, tells him to get out... the police officer goes back into his car to do whatever and comes back to see said speeder, who was caught close after the party, draw an object from his car after several attempts to tell him to stop... police is now fearing he could get shot and shoots before hand, accidentally killing him... idk man, i would do the same in his position
99.9 % of all the police officers are fine, it is just a few terrible ones that give the rest a bad image
You're an idiot.
