Seems a bit early in the season for Oscar bait?
[Here is the other official poster.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaYvEpMVMAA3ivw.jpg) 
Rainn Wilson's so dead. The funny guy always dies like ⅔ in. 
We're going to need a bigger Jason Statham.
Am I crazy or does the shark grow and shrink?  Like, the bite marks on the glass were "one guy can stand in the mouth of this fish" size, but then it's swimming under a crowd of people and they're tiny little specks compared to it.
My God, it's a Megalodon. 
I don't know why, but I always expected this to be serious, like 20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea meets Jaws.

Looks fun though.
I just want to see Statham punch a shark.
The dog in the water with the shark made me laugh.
[deleted]
Jason Statham was once a competitive diver before he got into showbiz. Regrettably, he was not able to compete in the Olympics, describing it as "a sore point" in his life. You just know he's going to channel that pain and aggression in his performance. 
Why is Ruby Rose everywhere? Was she good in anything? 
We found a creature that we thought was previously extinct whose only evidence of existence is fossil record... "we must find it, and kill it". 10/10 will watch, it's just too ridiculous not to.
This looks like glorious trash. I seriously can't wait. Gonna be a ton of fun if they keep the outrageous set-pieces coming throughout the entire movie the way this trailer does.
So its another Deep Blue Sea but with a megalodon, Jason Statham and Rainn Wilson...awesome!
This looks absolutely terrible, but in a way I can't wait to see.
Why did the creature's size fluctuate from being fantastically humongous to maybe being a little bigger than Jaws?
Me and every other user on r/thalassaphobia just clenched their butt
Thats the most jarring tone shift I have ever seen in a trailer
Love me some Jason Statham madness... I'm gonna be there opening night if possible!


The dog always knows when something bad is going to happen.
Wow I was completely sold on it for like the first 1:25 minutes. The tone, the atmosphere, almost felt like a horror movie. And then it turned into a goofy action trailer.﻿


From the early synopsis, it was going to be about a deep sea exploration team dealing with it, which I thought would be the entire movie. Seeing the above water scenes, just like in the book, finally has me hyped for this movie.
[This could be good, but will it top the greatest shark film that featured a Megalodon?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1XOfHax6Q8)
Just need some Cool J. "You ate my dog."
As dumb as this sounds I'm more hyped for this than Solo. Been waiting on this movie since I first heard about it. 
How many years has it been said that a movie adaptation was in the works? I'm so excited for this, the trailer far exceeded my expectations. Loved the books and can't wait for a good summer shark movie.
DEEPEST BLUEST MY HAT IS LIKE A SHARK'S FIN
I swear to god that shark was changing sizes throughout that trailer, how big is it supposed to be?

In that [old photo](https://i.gyazo.com/80a30fa6f296bd221d86a963689eacf2.jpg) the guy's height is just a bit smaller than the size of it's mouth, but then [elsewhere it looks a fair bit bigger](https://i.gyazo.com/2ece64b62eb7d2e9878f71591e13a770.png), then you've got [the fucking poster](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaYvEpMVMAA3ivw.jpg)

Is this a fucking Gigalodon or something?
I can already tell I’m gonna love this. I adore big monster movies set in an underwater setting, and this just looks like pure dumb fun.
Radon randell! Dreams!
The only thing that can kill that Mega Shark is... the Mecha Shark! 
few things:

this looks delightfully terrible. it'll be a great challenger to hurricane heist's best bad movie of 2018 crown

"and cliff curtis" is probably the saddest "and" credit thing ever lol

having this come out two weeks after shark week is a glorious idea, it'll get everyone who loves shark week (aka every normal human being on the planet) into the movie and you can get some easy advertising
Inb4 "shut up meg" comments
I’ve read the book series, which is still ongoing, and Jason Statham would not in any way be my choice for the main character. Don’t get me wrong, I love Statham, but he doesn’t work for the way the character is done in the book. Looks like they are combining elements of the first 2 books. The underwater research station was in book 2, The Trench, though in that book the station was owned by the bad guy and was at the bottom of the Mariana trench. Jason Statham’s character Jonas Taylor, wasn’t even married to that Asian woman until some time between books 1 and 2
So, how long until we get a Family Guy fan make a trailer of this, but instead of the shark, it's just a giant Meg? Anyone? PLEASE?!
Is this based off Steve Alton's series at all?
I am curious how they are going to work Statham's car chase and shootout into the finale. 
[The Meg's Original Poster, before studio interference](https://imgur.com/XhZbVCB)
Why is Ruby Rose in this? It's not like she puts asses in seats, and she can't act at all, aren't there probably a few dozen thousand better actresses out there to choose from? There should be plenty of talent out there that we don't have to ever see a bad actor twice. 
I don’t care how bad this will be, I’ve been waiting on this movie ever since I read the first book 13 years ago.  The author announced a movie and it was in development hell for SO long and now it is here.
They had me at Jason Statham vs a megalodon. 
The book series is stupid fun. Like if Jaws were written by a profoundly drunk Michael Crichton. I suspect the movie will be just as silly and fun. Not good in any real way other than forgettable fun. 
Subnautica The Movie
Shut Up, Meg.
SyFy did it! 
This looks so stupid. I need it in my life. 
The amount of weed I am going to smoke before watching this movie.... 
i'm shocked but this actually looks AWESOME! the shark attacking people scenes actually looks a lot more up close/nasty (in a good way!) than i initially thought they would (i figured the shark would just swallow up people whole). 
This looks fucking amazing.
1st Rampage, now this.

Year of the super sized beast.
I mean, I was already sold at the concept giant Shark and Statham + Li Bing Bing (aka Ada Wong in RE).  But this trailer makes it day one.
please... be rated r
Looks like a fun movie
Well this looks like the greatest film ever made. When the Stath says “it’s a Megaladon”. You just know. 
A shark this big is going to need an even bigger tornado to pick it up. 
So this is what happens when you give Asylum productions a 100 million dollar budget.
Man, this looks just flat out fun.
As far as giant shark movies goes this looks incredibly watchable. 
Jason Statham's answer to The Rock's Rampage
Damn, I thought they finally made.........


THE ROCK II: AQUATRAZ
I’m happy that Bruce got his own standalone film after being snubbed in finding dory. Looks great! Fish are friends, not food. 
All that shark sees is Jason Steakham
150 minion dollar budget for a goodnight shark movie.

What a bunch of madlads
That's a big fucking shark I tell you what boy.
Is it just me or did they play part of the It Follows soundtrack when the shark showed up with a tentacle in its mouth?
Feels weird to say this, but it honestly looks a little too small. In the books these things were the size of sperm whales. 
...200 miles off of the fastest-growing movie theater market...

...starring actors known globally...

...and costarring others to cater to that market...

...there comes a movie that really didn't need to be made...
It looks so stupid, I love it!
Dwight's there, that fucking shark stands no chance. This looks pretty watchable btw.
The crescendo from 1:17-1:22 is taken from the "It Follows" soundtrack by Disasterpeace, specifically the track "Anyone", from 1:22-1:27.

I need a hobby.
I loved these books as a kid. They were fast paced, gritty and horrifying. Got hyped when I see Statham in the thumbnail. Then halfway through the trailer they're teasing it as a cheeky comedy? Wtf...
[deleted]
China bait.
Banking on that Chinese money, eh?
I remember there being so many deep sea movies in the 90s and I loved them as a kid. This looks awesome.
this is gonna be a tough oscar race 
Is it me or does ruby rose look CGI?
This looks like a fucking blast?? Surprisingly stoked for this one
This looks like the perfect kind of dumb.
Love me a big dumb monster movie and this fits the bill 
I'm so seeing this!
This is the most August movie ever
> The uploader has not made this video available in your country.

So only US release?
Meh
Me starting the trailer: This seems so silly, who's it for.

Me after seeing its set off Shanghai: Ohhhhh, its for China. That also explains Jason Statham being the lead considering how big the last two Fast and Furious movies were in China. 
Glowing ball from beginning of trailer: https://www.sphero.com/education
Jason Statham is definitely going in that shark.
[Here](https://youtu.be/vWrINMm1aCI) is some behind the scenes footage of Statham diving in to battle the shark.
Shutup Meg
I bet it ends with Jason Statham killing the Meg with a propane tank and a gun.
Jason Statham might finally get the Oscar he deserves.
Good one, chum. 
I'm glad I didn't have a mouth full of coffee when I read that.
The shark’s name is Oscar?
I thought you were serious and this was a potential Oscar nominee. Then I googled what the movie was about...ugh
What kind of shark do you catch with Oscar bait?  A fuckin MEG apparently.  
For what? The remake of Jaws?
Agreed, there's something fishy going on here...
"Suck it, Spielberg."
Ok that’s clever. 
Sisiwakanamaur, is that official? it's freaking awesome!  thanx you for posting this! 
I have to say poster is pretty dope
"There's always a bigger fish."

Holy shit 😂
[Bigger Jaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtofVGtHmWU)
LL Cool J survived Deep Blue Sea though.
I’m not worried, Dwight Shrute has a survival guide for everything. *everything*
This movie will join the potential Rainn Wilson adventure trilogy with Sahara.
Actually Cliff Curtis is the one guaranteed to die early. Look at how he is billed. "And" in this very specific way means early death.
He's now doing a theater show in Chicago for a few months.

This was his paycheck to do whatever the hell he wanted for the next year. 
What about Benny in Deep Blue Sea?
Boy I hope so... I can't stand him.
That shark still has no chance to be honest.
This should share a world with Rampage.

I just made a billion dollar franchise.
LL Cool J survives.
The Rock
Got you covered.

https://youtu.be/yb682WbGgOA
[How's this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TazlEr6pIMk)
The Rock is busy Rampaging.
Movie logic here: maybe it grows by feeding.

Regular logic: probably just continuity errors.
It grows when it gets excited
SPOILER


In the book they are WTF OMG Giant Megalodon!!!


Later it turns out it was only a pub.
My thoughts on this is that the first scene is a flashback.  

I doubt this will be anything like the book, but Jonas Taylor (I assume statham in the movie) had a previous run in with a Megalodon before the main story of the book takes place.


In the movie this could just be the first time he saw hints of it, and it got much bigger in the years since.


In the book there was also more than one Meg.

The smaller one attacks one of their subs initially, gets caught in their cables, and gets chomped by a much bigger female who uses its' warmed blood trail to make it past the cold ocean.  (It originally couldn't leave the marianas trench due to the volcanic keeping the water warm in the depths and trying to leave would kill them.)




I'd suggest reading Steve Alten's book *Meg*  if you're interested in this story.

I read it back in middle school in like 2001, and I've been waiting for a movie ever since.  Hopefully it's good.
It's one of Chud's laws to great shitty movies.

1. Gratuitous nudity/sex scene that does nothing to further the plot or character development. 

2. Changing scale. Whatever the big bad is, it can't have any continuity in its size. Example: Snakes. Small enough to fit in a duffle bag, but big enough to swallow a man whole. 

3. Stock footage. This is mainly for shark movies, but can be found in other genres.

4. Questionable budget expenses. Like the CGI looks terrible, but they have some really good looking set pieces. Or the reverse of that. 

5. Questionable CGI decisions. As in why even do this? You could imply it, or not even have it at all. A great example is "the scene" in Mega Shark v. Giant Octopus. Seriously, do yourself a favor and Google it. 

6. Make the plot so ridiculous that there is no suspension of disbelief. Just straight up fantasy romp. 

I have been watching terrible movies for years, and these are the keys I've found to an enjoyable movie. 
There's definitely multiple different sized sharks.

You can clearly make out a large striped tiger shark towards the end chasing Jason.
>!Maybe there's more than one. In the book the megs are in the Marianna Trench and are kept in there because the water is super warm from some sort of lava vents and then super cold above that. The megs don't like the cold water so they have stayed in the trench. A boat catches one and while it's hauling it to the surface a bigger one attacks it and the warm blood that washes over it allows it to swim past the super cold water that has kept it in the trench. In the trailer is looks like the underwater habitat is probably in the trench. Hard to say for sure... it looks like the movie is only loosely following the book!< 
Probably a red herring for the REAL meg. 
Maybe it's mouth wasn't open all the way when it chomped the glass
Yeah, somethings fucky. They should have made the ship way bigger.
Not crazy. It went from truck to skyscraper sized and back again like 4 times in that trailer.
No buddy it's the light bending in water you know *duh*
Possibly more than one? With one of them being the kingsized shark
That one's the baby.
They kill it and that's what sets the mother off.
You also have the possibility that the teeth marks on the glass weren't at full open mouth but rather mostly closed.
Can this be the new Jesus Christ Jason Bourne?
An ancient animal and we have no idea how it has survived this long, better kill it.
My God, it’s a Suicide Squad. 
If they don’t play “Megalodon” by Mastodon in the film, I riot
[deleted]
I'm glad we're back to doing some ridiculous weird shit. It seemed like potentially solid movies like this went away for a bit. There was ridiculous shit, sure, but it was usually shit... this looks like it could be an enjoyable distraction.

Is it because China? This is largely financed by a Chinese production company, right? $150m is a lot for this concept.
If it’s Statham, he’s gonna play it all cool while in the water like he doesn’t have a gun, then the megaladon and his little shark buddies are gonna start surrounding him, getting ready to chomp his ass. Jason then does the finger gun and points at one of the sharks, they laugh it off, stupid human doesn’t have a gun, but Jason pulls the trigger of his finger gun and WHAM! One of the sharks explodes into chum after being blasted with a harpoon gun. The other sharks are in shock, and one by one they start getting impaled by random harpoons. In the megaladons confusion and through the haze of blood soaked water, the dolphin mafia shows up to help Statham take this fucker down for all the trouble it’s caused them. 
I'm personally hoping for chokeslam.
I think they did that on purpose, though I am not a Roger Ebert so what do I know. 
The dog in the water thing is so overused, but they actually made it funny this time. 
Definitely gonna get eaten lol
I mean it's got a 150 million dollar budget.
i agree 100%. i was hopeful this would end up being good (and it may end up being bad. it's just a really well made trailer)  and it looks FAR better than i had imagined! 
Did I miss something? What did Ruby have anything to do with it?

EDIT: Never mind, totally different Ruby Rose I was thinking of.
I mean....it sold me at Jason Statham vs a big ass shark. I didn’t need to see a preview. But now I’m for sure seeing this. Might be his best since The Transporter. 
As long as it's early in the movie I don't give a shit how she dies lmao 
Ive read most of Steve Alten’s books and he writes with a certain degree of dark humor. Its great stuff. 
Same. This looks legit good. You can make good movies about ridiculous topics. I think Asylum/SyFy ruined that idea.
I thought the trailer was pretty good. This film was shot in summer 2016 so I’m curious what’s happened to it since then. I think it was originally supposed to come out last summer. Maybe they reshot and edited quite a bit to change the tone to fun instead of cringe serious?
You like this movie and you posted a spoiler, congrats, epic shitpost.
That opening with the little girl was pretty creepy
I remember reading the book when I was a kid and it was full of great , cheesy, giant shark moments.
Yeah, I was expecting a shitty shark movie but this trailer actually looks pretty good.
I think the critical and commercial success of the Fast & Furious franchise has inspired a lot of these action movies with big budgets and hokey premises. It shows that the critics are willing to laud a well made film, even if it’s not Oscar bait. It’s a nice change from the Transformers era, where Michael Bay made dumb movies and took them really seriously. It’s great that modern action movies have a lighter tone and are just more fun to sit through. 

I fully expect that Rampage is shooting for a 60-70% on RT and my guess is the same for this movie. 
This and rampage looks actually good. 5 years ago I would never have wanted to watch this. 
Nah, 100% agree. It won't win awards, probably. But it'll be a fun ride. In a world of superheroes, I am kind of stoked for something different. 
I think it is way more fun, I agree. I’m glad they’re not trying to make this a super serious movie, I think it would come off as more of a SciFi channel movie but not in the fun way.

I will be seeing this movie if the tone of the movie matches that of the trailer
First word that popped in my head after the trailer was "fun".  Well, it was technically "this", cause I thought this looks fun.  But you get the point.
This looks freaking amazing!
It looks fun, while also being fucking terrifying.  That doesn't look like a cheap CGI shark... and the shots that they showed in the trailer didn't feel that cheesy to me.

I'm torn because I want to see it, and the cast looks awesome.  But also, I don't want to see it, because even the comedic relief in the trailer wasn't enough to offset my thalassophobia.  That opening scene was almost enough to make me nope away from that video.
> Also I'm pretty sure the trailer shows how Ruby Rose dies. :/

I may change my opinion about seeing it then. I can't stand her.
I was never not going to see this film based on the ridiculous premise and source material, but now I'm worried it could actually be *good*.
Its a summer release not late January. They usually put *some* effort into the former whereas the latter is for dumping trash. 
I think his [approach ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx04avR8C9A&t=22m9s)is more *off the cuff*
idk... she delivered her lines really well in John Wick 2.
Good at sucking at acting
I feel like she's filling a Hollywood quote or something. It's basically Hollywood producers seem to want her for a specific reason & her agent is... Well, whatever he/she is being paid... It needs to be quadrupled. Immediately.
Everywhere? She's been in, like, three movies.
you mean why is Li Bingbing in everything when China and Hollywood do something together
[deleted]
This film was shot almost two years back.
What else were they going to do? Let it live even though its clearly a danger to them all?
Deep Blue Sea is the second best shark film and I won't hear anything otherwise 
The book is crazier. The shark terrorizes the living shit out of Pacific Rim (wrecks McCovey Cove, destroys boats and helicopters in Monterrey Bay. It. Is. Glorious.)
I wonder how much cocaine it took for a Hollywood executive to greenlit and give this idea a $150M budget.
I'm more excited for Radon
More like The Office but replace Jim with Jason Statham and Michael Scott with a prehistoric shark. Expect Rainn Wilson's character to find his stapler in jello to start the movie.
Piranha 3D ain't got shit on this.
The music yells: "Yeah we know. See you in theaters ;)"
seems like a solid plot: 1) one of the greatest discoveries in history. 2) lets kill it!
It doesn't look terrible though? Looks like a fun blockbuster.
Maybe there turns out to be more than one, and the larger one is like the surprise end boss.
In the book there are multiple sharks, a male, a female (larger), and some babies.
The new Jurassic World is up there too haha
Already bought a shark costume in anticipation.
Same here!  I hope he punches the Megalodon in the eye socket!  Statham never disappoints.
Speaking of Jason Statham madness... for the love of all things good and holy in this world, where is CRANK 3?!!
Barking in real life: dogs beings dogs

Barking in movies: shits about to go down
It started as "stupid low budget horror schlock" and ended with "stupid action schlock", I'm excited.  This is the sort of movie you bring a flash of whiskey to and just have fun.
yeah, I was like yay a horror subnautica the movie

Then it became a straight to DVD teen summer movie like piranha 3d
> And then it turned into a goofy action trailer.

Having read the book a long time ago, that is FAR closer in tone to what the book is.
Imagine thinking this lmao
Greatest. Film. Ever.
Rest in Peace John Barrowman 
Wasn't it his parrot? 
Reminds me of "Your mother ate my dog!"
That was a long ass time ago. The version of the book I read back in 2007 said 'Soon to be a New Line Motion Picture' on the front of it.
The trailer for this actually looks like it’s entertaining 
Well the first photo is the size of the actual Megalodon fossil. The books made it twice as long as the real life estimates, so I'm sure the movie will do that and more. The poster pic is for comedic effect.
In the book there were also multiple Megalodons that varied in size, 40-70 ft. Not sure if they will keep that in the movie though.
> Gigalodon

https://i.imgur.com/4KotES9.gif
In the book, there are multiple sharks.
Don’t forget the appearance of the giant squid as well.
ctrl+f radon randell
Unless there is a malfunction and the mecha shark starts acting like a real shark. But it's ok cause you can just escape it by running on to land......OH WAIT!?! It has tank treds!!
Me and my roommate watched Hurricane Heist last night. I was disappointed. You watch these types of movies to be so bad they're good. HH just wasn't nearly ridiculous enough to have fun. It tried to be way too serious 

There was one scene where [there was a giant shredder/grinder used to tear up all the money, I said out loud "oh man someone is getting tossed in that thing for sure". Then no one was tossed in, for the entire film. They didn't even toss in any money. Come one, why show it and then not use it.](#spoiler)
Hurricane Heist actually had a good amount of fun schlock, like I would watch HH again way before Pacific Rim Uprising again. 
I was gonna make this comment until I watched the trailer and got something even more crazy to enjoy. Will watch.
[Best I could do on short notice](https://imgur.com/a/K5pCH)
I had no idea this was based on a book. Is it just called The Meg?
I always thought more of a Jeff Goldblum type would've been great for the main character
I'm bummed about this. I don't know why but I had expected it to try to be serious like the books but it looks like their going for something like Rampage with the Rock. I had looked forward to see a horror movie. Maybe we can get a movie version of The Loch
I have also read the books and you just summed up my thoughts entirely. I'm curious to see what they are going to do since it's not a direct adaption. I'm mostly disappointed that it is PG-13. I'm almost 100% sure that if you go straight from book to movie that it is rated R. Gotta get that wider audience for box office returns I guess. I'm ok with it if it means they keep making more.
You mean "Big Jaws?"

https://youtu.be/BsyLFBSkKmY

EDIT: Fuck, I misread your comment! My bad, mate. My bad.
Yep. Though I'm not sure if this is straight up book 1, or a combination of all four books.
[deleted]
That actually kicked off with Kong: Skull Island last year...lol!
Really wish he'd just pop in for a cameo and call the shark a Jabroni.
The film will.probably have a normal action tone with some horror elements. The trailer is likely being more fun and upbeat in order to draw more people in.
From what I remember, the author tries hard to keep the tone semi-scientific (like Crichton) but the overall story is just so over the top that it doesn't matter how accurate or inaccurate it is. I remember liking the book because it was always felt like it was going to be a movie. I'm intrigued by the trailer!
Deep Blue Sea is one of my most re-watched movies of all time.
what the fuck
If this movie doesn't end with him uppercutting The Meg, I'm not sure if the Academy can justify Best Actor
The other films that have to go up against Meg's premiere will be dead in the water. 
Should be the tagline to be honest.
Welcome to Jurassic Shark...
[I found it from Warner Bros. Indonesia account while I was clicking themeg hashtag on twitter.](https://twitter.com/WBPicturesID/status/983525427749634050) 
[So what it's big](https://youtu.be/O4MgfmuQ07Y?t=36)
Even bigger Jaws
Yeah but that's only because his hat is like a shark's fin. Rainn Wilson's not even wearing a hat.
Samuel L. Jackson died so he could live on. 
TJ Miller definitely extra died in Transformers though.
I think I read somewhere he was suppose to die in the original cut, but because Saffron Burrows' character tested so poorly with test audiences, they decided to kill her instead and let LL live.
he said the funny guy dies
He was really religious, though.  
> Sahara

I don't remember him being in that?
They're better be some damn good writing explaining why Statham can't just jump in the water and beat mega shark to death with his fists and British charm.
"mutant gigantic monster cinematic universe" Fuck it, just add it to the godzilla universe and have an avengers apocalyptic monster fight with Godzilla, King Kong, and Megaladon. Throw in some Ghidora and Mothra and we have us a party!
I'm convinced that Rampage is going to end with the Rock taking whatever growth shit makes his gorilla buddy big to get mega-sized, so the beat up the reptile together.
Any excuse to put Dwayne and Jason in another movie together I'm down.
Please. These'll make a billion each in China.
You ate my bird.
It's honestly funny to me that there's a token black guy. It's like in this day and age they're going out of their way to adhere to tropes.
the "LL Cool J Survives" Cinematic Universe
Logic from the books: there was more than one shark ranging from 45-60+ feet. Maybe they'll incorporate that into the movie.
It is a time lapse, the Chinese girl is Statham as a kid, flash forward 30 years and he is looking at the teeth marks of the event that has given him nightmares for years. He and the Megalodon have both grown in the time since their last meeting.
He's a grower not a shower
uhh, Phrasing?
The Winchester? Wait for it all to blow over?
Pup*
[Oh like that Godzilla anime](#spoilers)
If I remember from the book, wasn't it all white too?
You know you're in for a treat when a story rips off Jaws 3.
Mmmm, shark beer
Could humanity (and all the creatures of the ocean) deal with a 70ft Great White? 
Book the movie is based on justified it because of how invasive it proved to be to ocean ecosystems across the world.
 What are we, some kinda megalodon? 
My God, it’s some kind of a  Suicide Squad.
lmao this is based on a book??
The book was ridiculous but not Jason-Statham-ridiculous. 
So I'm down to just hear the ending now if you wanna share .
But (at least in the first two books) it takes itself pretty seriously. Like Alten legit thought he was writing the next *Jurassic Park*.
Ahhhhh!! Finally I was looking for someone who read the books, they're ludicrous. I've been waiting for this movie for 7 years now- I hope they knock it out of the park!!
I don't think the books' plots are any more ridiculous than any other sci-fi series. The tone of the books are pretty serious and, at least to me, suspenseful.

I loved the books. I plowed through the entire series in about a month or so. Impressive to me because I hardly ever read books. I read one of the books in about a day while on vacation. 
No one expects the dolphin mafia
You're hired for The Meg 2. 
Fuckin fuck you, Cheli-fucking-os!
In meg 2 the dolphin mafia stole his heart literally!
Now I'm gonna be disappointed if that doesn't happen.
You know that you're not Roger Ebert. In this sub that makes you an outlier. 
If you're not Roger Ebert, then who are you??
It's weird because the tone looks all over the place. Very serious at first, but then you have obviously comedic parts like this. Then there's Stathom throwing out some garbage lines. I'll watch it though, if only to laugh at all the silly crap.
Swallowed whole.
Chinese production company. They are trying to get a real foothold in the world-wide market. The Great Wall was a bust here in the States, curious to see how this plays. This actually looks ludicrous, but really fun, so it might actually have a chance of sleeper hit status.
[deleted]
I've been wanting this book to be made into a movie for 20 years.  Now that I've seen the trailer, it might be too good for me to handle.  It looks scary.

Right there with you. 
But in John Wick 2 she didn't have any ooooooh...
Lol
Good at making me fap
She’s a model. She’s great at making facial expressions; it’s the dialogue that’s bad.
every movie needs more Australians. And The Hemsworth brothers are too expensive these days. Though I'm sure the 3rd Hemsworth brother would enjoy some more exposure. his cameo in Thor Ragnarok was quite delightful
It looks like all she's been in is Resident Evil 6, xXx 2, Pitch Perfect 3, and John Wick 2, and if those movies alone compose a significant percentage of your movie diet you should probably work some more substantive film choices into your schedule.
She's fluent in English.
She's the new Michelle Rodriguez. She's everywhere and only ever plays the supposedly baddass chick that can never be wrong or made to look foolish..
Aren't you exaggerating a bit about her being in a lot of movies?

**Her entire IMDB catalogue of movies:**

* Pitch Perfect 3

Whatever...

* John Wick: Chapter 2

Legit movie

* xXx: Return of Xander Cage

Whatever...

* Resident Evil: The Final Chapter

Whatever...
It's up there as greatest film of all time, in any genre.
To this day, the death of SLJ is one of the biggest shocks I have ever seen in a movie. I would put it on a par with the twist in Sixth Sense in terms of how surprised everyone was who I saw it with.

Its legitimately a great movie.
Better than The Shallows?
Second only to Shark Tale right?
Pacific Rim 3 will be a The Meg crossover film.
You've sent me down an insane and hilarious wikipedia rabbit hole. The [plot summaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg:_A_Novel_of_Deep_Terror) of those books read like an 8th grade english essay a kid started the night before it was due and he didn't have a topic so he just summarized the whole thing 
And now I have a sudden urge to read the book
The most idiotic thing in the book is going after the shark with the USS Nautilus - because apparently, the author thinks you can turn a museum back into a working nuclear submarine with just a few hours work. 
And also fights other prehistoric sea creatures too. Which I’m kind of hoping they manage to work into this one too...

*wink
“Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go on an overnight drunk, and in 10 days I'm going to set out to find the shark that ate my friend and destroy it. Anyone who wants to tag along is more than welcome.”
The murikan way
The larger one spits out smaller ones.
Still got mine from the Superbowl halftime show a few years ago
If this doesn't end with Statham german suplexing the shark into a sea mine then this whole movie was for nothing.
Agreed! Where is it? 
I did 50 hours of subnatica and it's apparently now part of who I am. Not sure how to feel having these feelings reawoken. 
Not all of it. 
but we gotta find out if that hairy dude, Chewie,  survives.
Was expecting Quagmire :/
Like what more did you fucking want?

The hurricane grows a fucking skull face and roars. A man is killed by a hubcap thrown into the wind. The characters share a tender moment, while they pee. You have foreign actors speaking in terrible "southern accents". You have a woman with a tremendous lisp giving some of the worst line readings I've ever heard in a movie. 

HH was a goldmine of amazing moments. If you can't see it then you are lost. 




Chekov's money shredder. 
Pacific Rim Uprising takes the cake for dumbest film I have seen in theaters in quite some time. It is just a mess in every conceivable way. Like they mashed two, maybe even three, screenplays together and didn't try to tighten the resulting nonsense up and make it coherent. I'm almost certain the first draft had no monsters in it, and some executive forced them into the third act in a rewrite two weeks before production began. 
It’s called MEG: A Novel Of Deep Terror
[Amazon link.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N8Y8LEZ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_2rcZAbRA34ZVY) There’s also an updated version that includes a prequel short story that’s just called MEG
Were the books really serious? There doesn't seem to be a consensus in the comments.

I remember the first two being serious, but read them when I was like, 10, so I probably didn't have the best reading comprehension skills. And based on some comments here and re-reading plot summaries, it seems like the books may have been campier than I remember. (A lightning bolt taking out one of its eyes? Really?)
That, and Asian actors just so the film will sell in China.  Thank God there’s no big movie market in Peru, otherwise there’d have to be a random Peruvian actor in every bad movie.  Probably just the same guy over and over again.
prepare to lower your expectations when watching DEEP BLUE SEA 2. i watched it last night and it's pretty meh....it's just a rehash of the first film but with a lesser budget. 
and now, we're getting a [sequel/remake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nF465jHpqXk)
If it follows the book's ending (and based on one shot in the trailer, it looks like it might), it will be even better than The Transporter uppercutting a prehistoric shark.
Seeing Jason Statham RKO a shark would justify the price of a movie ticket.
Submission hold, Meg has to tap out with her flipper.
First he needs to get eaten by the shark and punch his way out.
I am 100% on board with this
This is never going to be a good movie, but at least it can go full "snakes on a plane"
"Bigger Jaws" 
> Welcome to Jurassic Shark...

[Already done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5ErhS9cn3s)
DEEPEST! BLUEST!
Classic rookie mistake.
Wait....he was wearing a hat through that entire preview....is there an inside joke I’m missing? Is this a IASIP reference I’m missing?
I rewatched the trailer. He’s wearing a hat in every shot he’s in. A different hat in every shot even. 
Come on bruh bruh, hat confirmed. He'll be fine.

https://imgur.com/a/bWrM6
Jules dying was pretty much a given in that one - that the girl died so the cook could live was the surprise there.
Fucking bullshit that. I remember me and my best friend rented this because it had Sam Jackson on the cover. And he dies in the first act.
  
It’s fucking Executive Decision all over again, which we saw at the cinema *because they marked Seagal as the lead.* Bull. Shit.
Yes but you could argue he wasn't very funny in that movie
is it really [you](https://youtu.be/cA7sB6llxqQ?t=152) ?
He plays Rudi. 
From the inside. Because his characters name is Jonah, no shit. 
[Acoustic impedence](https://www.quora.com/Can-we-talk-normally-underwater?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) would rob Jason of his voice underwater. 
Is that not [literally the plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MonsterVerse)?
This is actually the plan tho. Next year, a sequel to Godzilla 2014 releases which focuses on the other monsters revealed at the end of Skull Island, then in 2020, we'll get the crossover with King Kong.
And to pander to the Chinese market. This movie has it all!
Yeah that’s what I was guessing.  I hope the “there’s more than one shark” thing isn’t a twist, heh.
The "there's another one" is the most overused twist in monster movies. I hope its not that, and they come with a better explanation. 
I'm sorry, this is a *book*?
Maybe those are all baby Megalodons...
Oh noooo I almost wish I didn't read this...
> It is a time lapse, the Chinese girl is Statham as a kid, flash forward 30 years and he is looking at the teeth marks of the event that has given him nightmares for years

You see both him and the kid in one shot so there needs to be a time travel aspect somehow.


if it survived for that long and noone had any idea, why couldnt they?
It’s not a giant shark; on my planet it’s a symbol of hope.
Yeah, it's based on the first of a series of books. There are four total I think.
Here’s part of the plot summary from Wikipedia. I may need to pick these up: 

Jonas goes into the Trench within an Abyss Glider submersible while Celeste paralyzes Singer, leaving him to die at the maw of a Kronosaurus as revenge for killing her mother. However, he tells her her father couldn't impregnate women, so he impregnated Celeste's mother for him, thus revealing that Celeste is Singer's daughter. This does not stop her, however, and Singer last words are, "I'll see you in Hell."
Yip author is Steve Alten its like a 4 or 5 book series.
A series of books - five so far, I think 
The books are pretty entertaining. Not great literature but good vacation reads.
Heres the first one :D

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005HZDTAQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_gJmZAbFRMKKTA
Um, yeah, it was 100% Statham level ridiculous.
It had skiing behind a wooden ship in the middle of a hurricane. That's like 100% Statham. 
The movie will most likely be similar to Piranha 3D. A horror movie with comedic elements and some serious moments.
[deleted]
I find the Zorb Ball quite interesting, someone in there running away from it on water. 

Yeah it looks like a fun dumb movie a bit like Rampage tbh.
This, Rampage, and a few other movies just *scream* cheesy action movie but I can't wait to watch them

Your last sentence just described the appeal of the book as well. I am taking a guess that someone saw the massive appeal in the Chinese characters in the book, and the massive appeal of the cross-pollination of American Monster mania and Chinese movie-goers. Pac Rim 2 will clean house as well. Youll notice a lot more of these Chinese studios in the title cards, netflix, etc.
That China market that relies on spectacle that is universal will justify the budget
I think the budget is explained by the opening scene where they say its off the coast of China, and the fact that Li BingBing is one of the leads. They are easily going to recoup that money in China. 
I actually have a fond childhood memory of the book this is based on and I can safely say that $150 million budget movie starring Jason Statham is probably the last thing I ever thought would come from it,
Are you even allowed outside the sub, Fourteen? Get back in there!

But really, I love how every time Ruby Rose is mentioned a RWBY fan is like “What?! Oh, right, wrong Ruby.”
And she was a naked lesbian in The Orange is the new Black
As evidenced by John Wick 2, she played a mute and didn't ruin the movie!
well theres a difference between making facial expressions and making them believable. a good actor can make bad dialogue sound good. a bad actor is just a bad actor.  
Bingbingbingbing! Winner!
But Michelle Rodriguez was actually fun in a hokey sort of way in those movies.

Ruby Rose isn't.
Stevina Seagal.
Ruby Sue
All four of those movies came out in 2017. That's the point. Lately, she IS in a lot of movies.
You don't think being in 4 movies within a single year of each other  with all of them being major releases is "a lot of movies?"
I’m perfectly content living in this echo chamber 
1 citizen kane 
2 deep blue sea 
3 lawrence of arabia. 
Sharks don't care about black people 
...almost as shocking as Steven Seagal's demise in Executive Decision.
Oh yeah!
A shark that turns into a fighting robot? Two words: Beast Wars. 
I read the entire series after a thread like this sent me down the same hole two years ago. It's amazing and hilarious.
I read the Meg back in 2000 when I was 13 and it was the best thing ever. Kept reading the guys books through my teens. His last few were apparently awful though.
The book was about as serious as a book about a giant prehistoric shark eating people could be. Plus Jonas Taylor was a nerdy academic instead of the Stath. 

The sequel (simply titled 'MEG') has the Meg fight Kronosauruses next to a seafloor fusion reactor funded by Osama Bin Laden. I am not even kidding.
Go for it bud. Read the book in high school and loved the book so much I did a PowerPoint presentation for my bio class on the Megaladon. 
the 1st 3 were all pretty great.  i can't account for 4 and 5.
It’s a great pulpy read. Like the classic “monster” novels of the 80’s
I read the book in high school after being severely disappointed with the JAWS novel.
That's an endangered species at most. What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?
Of course, it was so obvious...

https://cdn.wikimg.net/strategywiki/images/9/99/SMB3_enemy_Big_Bertha_with_baby.png
Alright, you're invited.

I'm planning a full screening of shark costumes.
I'd prefer him surfing down a tsunami, firing a bazooka at the meg myself.
Fucking warpers. 
[deleted]
Plus it features the greatest vehicle in film history, The Dominator. 
......the hurricane has a face?
What? A hurricane growing a skull face and roaring? 
Awesome thanks. I love all things shark so I’m in. 
Scumbag third party sellers noticed the jump in activity and have raised the price of the paperback copy to $900...

https://i.imgur.com/TLpIFQf.png
If the plan is to let the shark swallow him whole and cut his way out, Dave Bautista would like a word. 
Can't really remember, it's been a while since I read it, but doesn't he [kill it from the inside?](#spoiler)
Can you spoil that for me?
I was gonna say, having read the first one, it does look like it's going to end the same way.

Which was fucking awesome.
Go even further. F5 that Megalodon.

You know it’s weird but I am too. All these Chinese financed movies starring a well known American actor have been terrible and this is the first one I don’t hate so far. 
If your on board we may need a bigger boat. 
Also he was originally supposed to die apparently (and Saffron Burrows was supposed to live).  But then test audiences hated her character but liked him so they switched things around to have her die and him live.

You can even see in the film the specific scene where they most likely made the switch.
Dude I literally went back and watched the trailer again. He is literally wearing a different hat in every shot he’s in. 
Deep Blue Sea joke. Cool J wrote a song for the movie with that line in it.
Peak Saffron Burrows, too.
> Jules dying was pretty much a given in that one

That kind of character always dies at the end, though, not in the first act.
I hear all the actors write their part of the script themselves.
I need to know
Huh, guess I'll have to check look for it when I watch again. Havent seen it in a while.
Well Tom Cruise went and fucked it all up.
This film is probably going to do like 50%+ of it's gross in china. Action movies that are so so are box office gold there because action is cross culture.
That will 100% be a twist. Like 2/3rds of the movie will be all, ohhhhh, it's spooky at 25 feet long! And then it gets eaten by a 150 foot nonsensically large shark. 
It was in the first third of the first book.  Not a huge twist.
If it follows the book in any way then the beginning should show it being able to climb from the Marianas Trench because some very specific stars align. So, Angel(this shark) never actually lived anywhere except down there.
Well, over here it means 'shark'.
Five now, with an upcoming sixth.
Brutal lol

They are so dumb and so good
The book are absolute trash and hilariously bad to read.  They get worse with each sequel.  I recall the story entirely falling apart as early as the second book.  It was as if entire sections never went anywhere and others were slammed out in a few minutes.


Goddamn, that's great writing.
Nah, the first one was at least attempting to be a little serious. Yeah, they had the shark leaping out of the water to try and catch a helicopter and of course the infamous ending but it was surprisingly restrained for schlock. 
I really don’t remember that from the first book at all and I’ve read it, and only the first one, probably twenty times. Is that from one of the sequels or do I have too many holes in my brain?
Doesn't matter if it makes money in China. Which it will. 


Great Wall grossed $45.5 million in the United States and Canada. 

It also grossed $170.9 million in China.
I'm guessing 60M opening weekend in the US. It won't bomb. It's got Dwight and Sharks and boobs. Three of America's favorite things. 
At one point it had directors like Del Toro and Actors like Clooney attached to it.  It was a big deal for a lot longer than I thought it would be.

Instead we get this...  which is probably still a lot more than the book actually deserves.  It was dumb fun but this is 150 million dollars, which is stunning.
[deleted]
If only we would have gotten a Beast Wars movie instead of Transformers 2,3,4, and 5
Rhinox would tell you why this trailer is bullshit, with ATTITUDE.
The sequel was called The Trench.
And now I want to read the sequel.
I remember reading this when it came out in 5th grade. I don't remember a damn thing about it except that I loved it.
It has not aged well.

This on the other hand looks like it doesn't take itself too seriously and I am actually kind of excited for it.
Revenge.
The fact that it could be an extinction level event for anything living in the ocean?
lol wtf?

Are they hoping people will buy it accidentally or something at that price?

It's something like that.  From what I remember, [He's inside some mini-sub or something.](#spoiler)
It's been decades since I read, so this may be slightly off. 

[He drives that mini sub(briefly shown in the trailer) down the shark's throat into its stomach, and then knifes it in the heart from the inside. The sub also gets stuck against the shark's teeth on his way out and almost drags him down past crush depth as it sinks if I recall correctly.](/sp)
Sharknado would like a word.
But the RKO can come out of nowhere. Would be such an amazing moment.
Because they are bad sci fi movies that they put a budget behind...i for one love the shit out of all of them because it proves no matter the actor its so bad it is still awesome. Love shitty sci fi neeeeed moooore!
The scene where she essentially throws herself at the shark?
>"I never meant for this to happen"

With dumb fucking lines like that she deserved to get chomped
Yeah, she's the villain of the movie. How was that not clear to them earlier?
That is cool. I didn't know that. I love that movie. The SLJ getting eaten scene is one of my favorite things ever, especially considering he was one of the highest paid actors in Hollywood at the time. We get Thomas Jane's first lead role in a major motion picture. LL does a much better job than expected. And, in the end the arrogant scientist with some mixed morals gets what she deserves, there is no contrived romance, and the token black guy lives. 

I need to go watch that again.
And that was?
Ahhh. Yeah I was like 9 when that movie came out lol. I must have missed all of that. 
Tom Cruise fucked up a different monster universe.
Angel is the really fucking huge shark, if I recall correctly. Her sister is somewhat smaller, but more mean tempered than her.
Have you ever heard the tragedy of Megalodon The Shark?

what about the time i kept running into you on r/Marvel 

A User cannot serve ~~two~~ three masters
[deleted]
With a reboot most likely releasing in the next 5 years, perhaps we'll finally get Beast Wars.
He was quoting *Life Aquatic*.
yeah the mini sub gets nommed but he exits and cuts its heart out, iirc, with a fossilized meg tooth
IIRC its even better than that,, he uses a fossilized megalodon tooth instead of a knife. It's fantastic.
Yep, and when the shark grabs him earlier on.
CGi was pretty good too. All round great film.
Once they get up to the surface, the bit where she leaves herself as bait for the shark but then the metal steps fall into the water and she can't climb out. Then LL Cool J gets harpooned to the shark.
All good, pretty sure it played over the credits and not during the film itself.
So originally it was her and a mate and she ends up eating the mate as she ascends up through the water to the surface. The warmth from the blood from her mate allows her to make it through the freezing water she normally wouldn't be able to pass through. 
Correct. Angel was the offspring from the Meg in the first book. She was some 70ft long beast. In the later books she birthed Bela and Lizzy - two dangerous twins who hunted together. Silist (below) is spot on with the details of the first Meg.

I too love the books. It is a shame Steve Alten has made his latest Meg novel available only on his website. The delivery to the Uk costs more than the book so forget that!
... Shut up, Meg.
Oh no. I don’t know about any of this. I guess it’s time to read them. Quickly. 
Not even that would save that fucking train wreck. I didn’t even pay for that movie and felt like I was ripped off. 
Perhaps a spoiler tag?
Bad ass.
You are exactly right, and I thank you for rekindling that awesome memory. 
She had an amazing camel toe in that one scene.
Wasn't that book just the most ridiculous, dumbest, yet simultaneously coolest shit ever? 
That makes so little sense it hurts. I love it.
13 year old me fucking loved this book so much.
We were really in to it in school. We read it in 9th grade as a class in my science course. The author lived 5 minutes from the school so I'm sure that's why we did it. He came in once to talk about the book (this was 9 or 10 years ago) and he told us all about how different production companies all took a shot at making it in to a movie but it didn't work out. Good for him, finally getting it out there. 

Just a side memory since you said it was ridiculous. I can't help but agree. I remember one scene from the second book, which I couldn't even get 50 pages in to. This pops in to my head every once in a while. There's a part where this super hot girl (pretty much how he describes her in the book) is having sex with a nerdy chubby guy as a way to get information out of him. The line as they wrap up the sex is "she felt him finish inside her." It sounds exactly like someone who thinks they know what sex is like, describing sex. I never thought this would be relevant in conversation, but here we are
The book sounds like every killer monster book I loved reading while in middle school and I hate everyone in my life for not making aware of this series. 
Yes.
Yep, absolutely loved them. They're so ridiculous and completely own.
That's really cool actually, I would have loved his books as a kid.

I mean, I think we need ridiculous and fun stuff like this. Not every book needs to be Faulkner, right? Sometimes you just want a bit ol greasy cheeseburger of a book or movie or whatever. 

Oh man, while we're talking about cringy parts. I'll never forget the line, "He felt a cool pair of Asian eyes on him." when he was at some conference.

Who writes like that! 
That book was so insane and so bad and so fun. As a kid, I emailed Alten. He emailed me back every time. He seemed super nice.
yea i remember reading the book and can't imagine it being a 'school book': for every line of 'science', there's a paragraph of random sex stuff
