I didn't think it was possible for him to look any older than he did in Gran Torino ... 10 years ago.
“So help me God, this is the last one.“

Couldn’t help but think that he was talking about moviemaking. Made me sad.
This looks freaking great. Looks like Clint Eastwood has really delivered with this one. 
Just a reminder that this is the second Clint Eastwood movie of the year.
Go on his Wikipedia. He has separate articles for each decade of his professional life. Damn.
He's 88. Eighty-Eight Years Old. And he's still kicking hard. Damn.
Wow. That looks really good. Guess this is on my radar now.
I know Eastwood is already the GOAT but the fact that he can dress and act like your *average* 88 year old man is amazing.

I like how the cast looks loaded as fuck, but Eastwood is the only one who gets named.

Must be one of the many benefits of being Clint Goddamn Eastwood.

**Edit:** I just looked up "The Mule" on Google, and [this is the poster I found.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/The_Mule_poster.jpg)  I guess it'd be too much to ask that this upcoming movie uses the same layout with Eastwood as the guy bending over.
This looks super intriguing 
This is honestly one of the best trailers I have ever seen. The voice over is clearly him speaking to his family. Wow. 
Really well edited trailer
Reading up on his past personal life this movie seems SUPER personal for him. He lived a very adulterous life, 7 kids which seemingly he wasn't that involved with and it all seems because he was so wrapped up in his own career and self. 

This may be a known thing to most and some of my facts may be off, but that was from a quick read and I never knew that about him.

Makes this movie that much more enticing. 
They shot a lot of this in my hometown of Augusta, GA. So dope seeing places I instantly recognize on screen. 
Clint is definitely the premier director in the "movies you take your dad to" genre. 
What a fantastic trailer.
are we finally gonna see clint put drugs up his ass
Working away on this film as I type this.
My dad will like this
That trailer. Was. Amazing.
Andy Garcia has a nice little second wind going in his career rn. Cool to see
That look in the last shot is come classic Clint. Looks fantastic.
Clint Eastwood's Breaking Bad
Major familial regret and one final act of redemption seems to be common here. Either this is a theme Eastwood likes to work with dramatically, or is he doing some self-therapy here?
Looks absolutely fucking great.  I wish Clint would do one last western before he hangs it up.  Obviously he wouldn't be the bad ass gunslinger, but there's still stories that could be told.  
SEE, THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A FUCKING TRAILER. NO FUCKING SPOILERS BUT YOU GET AN IDEA OF THE FILM. Holy fuck, it's not that hard filmmakers. 

Great trailer- thought the "THIS IS MY LAST ONE" was super cheesy, but goddamn, looks like it's gonna be a dope Eastwood film. 
Wait, I swear I've heard that background piano before ... I want to say it's from Suicide Squad but I'm not sure.

EDIT: Yeah, kind of reminds me of the sad "[I started a Joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kAEZH769R8)" they played during the teaser trailer but, I don't know, I swear I've heard that exact piano track somewhere; it's so familiar! 
Fuck yeah, this looks great. Great to see a return to crime drama too. The man certainly knows the genre. 
Not to be confused with the Australian movie from 2014 called The Mule. I don't recommend eating while watching it.
I'm racking my brain, but I can't place the music in the trailer.  Does anyone recognize it (or what else it's from)?  
This motherfucker is a billion years old and drops solid gold like his Depends are Fort Knox.
It's based on a true story about a WW2 veteran and world renowned horticulturalist who became a drug mule for the Sinaloa Cartel when he ran into money troubles. At his trial, he offered to pay a US$500,000 fine by growing Hawaiian Papayas for the state if they wouldn't send him to jail.
This looks incredible. The trailer was so well done. I got chills by the end. 
Anything Clint Eastwood I'm watching 
I dont know what surprises me more: the fact hes still making movies or the fact hes still alive
So, considering that final scene, he totally kills the police officer right?
Bradley Cooper and Eastwood = 200M hit confirmed!
Honestly, this is how you do a freakin trailer. You have an idea what the story is about, but you don't know what direction the movie is going in. It doesn't spoil anything. It leaves you wanting more.

I wish more trailers were like this.
Clint Eastwood is my favorite celebrity of all time. 
Looks awesome. I can't wait to see it.
Not Foundation.  :(
Mmmm... pecans.
So pumped for this. Looks amazing and looks like it has a great cast 
Damn kudos to Eastwood for continually pumping out films. Looks like an interesting late entry into the Oscar picture
It has been so long since I've been excited for a Clint Eastwood movie. Feels good. 
Needs more upvotes.
Where is he gonna find the second mule, he needs Two Mules for Sister Sara
Now that's a good trailer. 
Goddamn that was an amazing trailer 
Expected a Foundation adaptation from the title.
Is it me or does every single soundtrack he composes sounds exactly the same? 
Looks like they didn't take anything from The Foundation series, I didn't recognize a single character. 
You feelin lucky punk? Clints the best 
Fuck yes. This looks so goddamn good.
Looks really good! Did he direct it as well?

Edit: ahh yes he did. 
Looks fucking sick, dude.
That looks awesome!
[Happy National Taco Day!](https://twitter.com/HopNationUSA/status/1047933034048249856)
Fuck yeah!  looks good
I hope that K9 unit stopped there for a reason and it's not just coincidence they got him...
“The last one”
Based on [Leo Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Sharp), the oldest drug mule in the world who was almost exactly as old as Eastwood is now when he was caught (Sharp was 87, Eastwood is 88).

EDIT: Something else I have just realized: With Eastwood and Redford, two Hollywood veterans will play real life criminals as their respective last roles in the same year.
I thought this would be that train movie. I had no idea that movie came and went.
Tread lightly in your bathrobe.
I'm like hey Clint Eastwood has a new movie coming out. My wife is like what's it called? I'm like it's called the Mule. She's like is it a western? I say no only to realize how much I would like to see another western by Eastwood.
Thought this was going to be the US release of the 2014 Australian film "The Mule"
[Waffle House and police lights.](https://youtu.be/N_QksSzK7sI?t=102) 

Name a more iconic duo. 
Damn Clint looks like a fucking skeleton. Movie looks great though 
Anyone else think the music makes this feel like a fantasy/sci-fi? 
GET OFF MY CRACK!
Sad they left out the visisonor.
Looks good. Michael pena is the new Sam Jackson,  seems like he's in every movie now lol. 
I thought he retired from acting with Gran Torino? Seems like people who say they retire still get the itch later on to make films. At this point, I expect Robert Redford to come back later. 
my opinion on films directed by clint eastwood ranges from indifference to outright hate. i've never liked any of his films but wiling to give this one a go and see if it changes.
Clint is a force of nature...he just KEEPS. ON. DELIVERING.
He kept saying last one. I kept saying no.
Wouldn't be surprised if this is his sickly sweet syrupy music.
It was really hard seeing him frail and scared in that one shot in the montage near the end. Affected me more than I was expecting. 
"This is the last one" instantly made me sad.
What song is that? I’ve heard it before but can’t place it. Feel like it’s a classical song maybe...
Great trailer, really put together well, the music swells to the end which ratchets up the tension. Looks great too with a top notch cast. Clint does look really old now, which adds to the emotional power of the trailer. 
For anyone at all who might be interested in the music of the trailer, it’s a “dramatic remix” they made of “Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Variation 18”.

Just saw the trailer and recognized the melody.
Anyone know the name of the song from this trailer?
What’s the song,  there’s another film that has the same notes except it goes up at the end instead of down??
It doesn't get better than Clint.
Wow, this looks incredible.
This is one of the first times I've seen Eastwood do vulnerability.  He projects himself as such a bad ass in every film he does, even in stuff like Unforgiven where he appears vulnerable at first, but they allows himself to go back towards a darker place.

I'm worried about the politics of this movie though.  Eastwood has been a very right wing film maker as of late, with his last film being so patriotic I thought a fucking American flag was going to burst through the screen, and I'm curious if he's trying to say something about the war on drugs or immigration with his Mexican characters.
won't the mule not make any sense without the first book?
First time I am hearing about this movie but it looks really good. Although can we please stop casting Michael Pena in stuff it makes it harder to watch knowing he is a Scientologist 
This looks pretty bad
Clint Eastwood is a piece of shit, and his movies suck. Fuck you reddit. Go ahead and downvote me.
My first thought was—didn’t Walt die in the last one?
I swear to god he's going to live forever just out of sheer fuckin' will
TBF He did look mighty old when he talked to that empty chair 
Just watched it; he seriously seemed so frail, I was worried any time someone touched him
Given the themes, this really does feel like his most personal film yet. I wouldn't be surprised if he considers this movie his swan song. He's also probably a shoo-in for Best Actor/Director Oscar nods.
Gave me fucking chills.
If I directed The 15:17 to Paris I would have considered ending my career also.
Well, he claimed he was [retiring from acting](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/3507352/Clint-Eastwood-to-retire-from-acting.html) after Gran Torino and here is again, so even if he is talking about moviemaking, I'm not sure I believe him.
dude has got the energy and vigor of a 20 year old fresh out of film school. this isn't his last. he's gonna be making movies until his dying breath.
This trailer was really similar to The Old Man & the Gun, both look like swan songs from the lead actor (Redford's film actually is his last movie role)
No way, he’s going to be 110 still pushing through somehow!
kurt douglas laughs at you
I was thinking his last acting performance but yes that too. 
He's aging, and it'll be a truly sad day when he passes on to the next Frontier. Everyone will wear panchos. 
reminds me of haksaw ridge 
[deleted]
>really delivered with this one

Nice.
Shades light to a huge problem too. The biggest movers of drugs in America are white soccer moms and the elderly. 

There's a great mexican book about this very subject that's called "American Narcos" that goes in great detail how drug cartels operate in the U.S and why figures like "El Chapo" don't really exist in the U.S
I'd hope this is his best movie in 10 years. He hasn't really hit a great movie since Torino
Got to hand it to him. Scrotum skin and all.
[deleted]
This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
The trailer was well done. I just worry with Clint Eastwood these days. He could easily turn it into some cheesy America propaganda bullshit about building a wall.
Lets pretend like this is the only one 
The eighth such year of his career. Longest gap between films since he started in 1971 has been three years, and that's only happened twice.

He's shockingly prolific as a director. Really never stopped churning them out. 
Yeah, well I’ve bought 10 burgers and the 11th one is free but ya don’t hear me bragging!
My mother, in great mental and physical shape for her age, is 87 and barely walks to the mart down the street. 
https://imgur.com/a/aTek1GY

Please can someone be a detective and find out who is the real OP 🤔 
Kicking like a mule.
Ian McClellen is 79 and Patrick Stewart is 78. 
Not to mention they very recently wrapped the movie and it's already getting released
taking bets now on who lasts longer, godard or eastwood 

both have major features this year 
Dude was alive when A Star is Born Came out for the first time in 1937.

It's now been re-released three more times, most recently by his protege, Bradley Cooper. 
It was really good. 
And he would still kick my ass up and down the street.
Lmao, is that discount Hugo Weaving and Mel Gibson in that poster?


Edit: That IS Hugo Weaving. lol
The supporting cast is named at the end of the trailer 
That movie is actually really entertaining and at times absolutely disgusting.
Wait wait wait... Leigh Whannell was in that? I have to see it.
Seems legit 
What's Walter Bishop doing there?
Or the police after getting caught

i agree--incredibly gripping without sharing too much, and the score for the trailer (the rising orchestra in the background leading up to the final moment) was amazing
Hell yes Augusta. If you're ever back, there some seriously good restaurants downtown. I miss them. 
This pun is too easy.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I’m from Augusta too, when did they film this? Been at school for a while but I’ve been home every once in a while and never even heard about this. Totally awesome  I’m glad we’re finally getting  some movies shot in town 
My dad and I bond and spend time over movies. He watches all the Marvel movies with me, I’ll watch this one with him.
Hell, I'll take my brother and my dad to it.
I highly recommend watching the movie The Mule from 2014 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2130270/

it's literally about a guy holding in his shit and it's actually really good and surprisingly tense
They already announced a sequel called The Boofer
The wait is over.
Clint could do ALL of those drugs at once and you know what would happen? The drugs would die - they would OD on Clint motherfuckin Eastwood!
Mr. Eastwood?
?
My dad won’t stop watching Second Hand Lions.
I think I'll take my dad to see this.
Such a great yet underrated actor. He'd do great on tv. 

Kind of his third wind if we count the Oceans movies. 
Go ahead, say my name.  
Not necessarily either or. Could be a mix of both and I would be surprised if it weren't.
I think Unforgiven was his swansong for westerns.  
> dope Eastwood film.

Quite literally
Don't know the recording, but the music is from Rachmaninoff's *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini*. The middle section -  here: https://youtu.be/koqOEd10GdI?t=905
It reminded me of something from The Social Network.
It was also used as the main theme of the film Somewhere in Time starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. 

My mom was obsessed with that movie so I learned how to play it on the piano for her. 
It's driving me crazy, too!  I know it from somewhere...
["Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini"](https://youtu.be/z1JW4MEEDDw) by Oumi Kapila.
Did you ever figure this out?
It's from Rachmaninoff's *Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini*. The middle section -  here: https://youtu.be/koqOEd10GdI?t=905
It sounds like that song Bill Murray plays on the piano in Groundhog Day. 
no, Leo Sharp irl never killed anyone. he was convicted on drug trafficking and let out of prison after a year or so shortly before he died. 
Wouldn't it be amazing if a Foundation movie came out and it looked like a regular drama with a supposedly weird name like this?

In other news, this thread is FULL of suspiciously similar comments. I assume they're mostly bots.
I can guarantee you, it doesn’t, since he didn’t compose it.

It’s a “dramatic remix” of Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Variation 18. 

Composed by Rachmaninoff, based off of Paganini’s 24 caprices, no 24.
Eastwood's not playing Sharp, it's just based on him. Has a different name in the film. 
Just so you know, the music is a “dramatic remix” they’ve made based on Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, variation 18. 
Search it up and see what the original composition sounds like.
The music is a dramatic remix of “Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, variation 18”.
"This is one of the first times I've seen Eastwood do vulnerability."

Um, he was the definition of vulnerable in Million Dollar Baby. The scene with the priest near the end where he's basically sobbing his eyes out.
He was pretty vulnerable at the end of Gran Torino. 
he's pretty vulnerable in bridges of madison county. 
A total, racist POS
[deleted]
True, but many did say the same when Gran Torino was coming out 10 years ago.
He lost Best Actor twice to actors playing blind. If someone could come up with a gritty Mr. Magoo reboot he might have a shot.
You think him making a movie about being an old drug mule for the cartel is his most personal movie yet?  
The great thing about Clint is when he makes a bad movie, just wait a year, the next one will probably be better. 
[deleted]
I totally forgot he even made that last year. Was it that bad? 
I mean if you have the patience to go through the first 80 minutes of filler, the final 10-15 minutes or so is pretty damn killer. Respect to those guys because they're real life heroes but man, Clint should have let the pros take this one.
I've legitimately never seen a movie of his that I don't like
Or you know, just a ton of money and connections...
As long as an actor is still alive, I never believe a movie is their last role(unless they're incapacitated like Sean Connery). 


Redford actually backed up on that claim recently. 
*Kirk
the fuck you talking about, nobody in power in the industry is shunning clint eastwood.
Wtf are you talking about? I think u might be confusing him with Mel Gibson...
I hope this isn't a dumb question, but did you mean that literally? Like moms and the elderly are the primary way of moving drugs? 
I would love to read this book. Do you know where I can find it?
I would that *Grand Torino* features the best Clint Eastwood acting in a long while but the overall movie was good, but not great. 

I think that his last great directorial features were *Letters From Iwo Jima* (2006) and *Mystic River* (2004). Those were the movies I had the most emotional responses to, especially *Letters* since the movie itself was kind of a surprise to me and I watched on a whim. I think he's gotten some great performances from his actors, like Bradley Cooper in *American Sniper*, but most of the the movies since have been okay to good. 
Sully?
American Sniper
He’s had a bunch of movies, he just hasn’t starred in them too. 
What the fuck about that trailer makes you think American propaganda?
I laughed

He also rarely does more than five takes, ever, and quite frequently does all the shots in one take - in fact, in interviews, actors have discussed how they thought they were doing rehearsals and that footage ended up in the movie 
I think I might rank him as the best director. Ever.

Just my opinion though.
Hey man, that’s pretty good too.
Shit, I'm 39, and I barely walk anywhere.
My grandmother is 93 and was recently partially run over by a car. She's annoyed she needs a walker some of the time now. I really hope I got her genes. 
If she was rich since the 60s it might be a different story. 
That's me as well lol. I can prove it hold on

edit: okay look at the replies to that comment now ;)

I made those comments here first. Couple minutes later got a notification that they just uploaded the trailer so went there and left the same comments. u/Stargos_of_Qeynos, I have no affiliation with the film or Eastwood, just karmawhoring. :)
Lol, must be Eastwood's publicists working hard to spread the good word.

edit: Nope, but maybe he should be paid.
i'd like to think godard will live on in a sentient machine similar to the computer from alphaville
John noble
Nope, real Hugo Weaving and Angus Sampson, who has also been in Fargo season 2, Mad Max: Fury Road, Shut Eye (cool Hulu show) and the Insidious movies!

It's a great movie!
I'm here right now!! I was going to go to the open casting call for The Mule, but I was very busy working on my album (I'm a kinda sorta well known Hip Hop artist on the Indie level) and so I never got around to it. But this movie looks great and it's so nice to see the AUG in such a high profile project. This will be great. 

Augusta has had a film office for about 5-6 years now, and movies shoot here all the time, but this is the only one that's truly reputable that I can think of, off the top of my head. 

I was genuinely pissed that Get On Up didn't take advantage of Augusta. It was the perfect opportunity. There are parts of Augusta that look like they're stuck in a time loop. 

As far as restaurants, what were some of your favorites? We have a lot of great restaurants here and not just downtown. There are a lot of hidden gems around the CSRA. For example, Best Bites Mediterranean in Martinez is one of my favorite places. I also like The Village Deli in Daniel Village. 

I live on the Southside, right off Peach Orchard, so I spend a lot of time eating at Veracruz and The Chinese Buffet. Those are 2 of my favorite places in the entire city to grub. The Philly Cheesesteak Factory is pretty good as well. 

I try to support the locally owned and operated businesses over all of the chain restaurants. 
Why yes. Yes it is! 
Mr. Brown signed my Father to a record deal at the age of 19. I am forever grateful to him for that. My love for music and my decision to go 100% all in on a Hip Hop career all comes from my Dad. The only difference is he had an amazing voice, I can't sing a lick. I did inherit his songwriting and rhyme skills, though. Thanks Pops! 

If anyone is wondering, my Dad was lead singer of a band called Santa Fe Train. They're extremely obscure now. But in Augusta in 1972, they were the talk of the town. 
Why do you ask? 

There's a drug problem in every city, to be honest. 

I personally don't think there's a drug problem in Augusta. I think that just like anywhere else it all depends on what social circles you frequent. 
The shot of Bradley Cooper using that camera is definitely downtown Augusta. 

Not sure which Waffle House that they filmed at. 

But I recognized parts of I-20 & Bobby Jones Expressway 
It was back in July, I work down town and they filmed a lot over Reynolds and James Brown blvd. It was cool sneaking over on my lunch to watch them work.
Maria Full of Grace is also a good mule movie
Seconded. This is an absolutely riveting movie. Not what I expected at all.
How is this new movie not copywrite infringement?
Is it about anal sex or about flatulence?
sound editor and mixer ... I make the fart jokes
Your dad has good taste. 
Your dad has excellent taste.
My dad has good taste 
What's is it?
He was the primary antagonist in the second season of "Ballers" on HBO.
"Blondie.."
Yes.  And was used in Bridges of Madison County as well.
Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Variation 18. That’s the specific one.
Groundhog Day. Bill Murray plays it on the piano. I figured it out when someone else in the thread asked the same thing. It was bugging the hell out of me then it clicked haha
It’s by Rachmaninoff, but I assume you mean “played by Oupa Kapila”.

Daniil Trifonov’s interpretation is the nicest I’ve heard, so I’d recommend listening to his.
Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Variation 18.

Composed by Rachmaninoff, based off of Paganini’s 24 Caprices: Op. 1 No. 24. 

I’d recommend you listen to Daniil Trifonov’s interpretation of it.
That's a load off my mind.  
Damn, and here I am commenting it to other people, thinking I was the only one who knew it (who is on this post).

Specifically, it’s Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Variation 18. For anyone who wishes to search for it on Spotify or such.
You beautiful savior!  That's it!
Yes, it is.
Well that is some next level information. And you came all the way down to the lowly comments to give it! Thanks Daniel. 
Walt Kowalski
Christ, that was ten years ago?  Meanwhile I still look at Unforgiven as recent-ish. 
and people thought *that* was the big swan song

can we expect another contemplative, legacy-referencing film from Eastwood in 2028?
He's acted since then. He did a baseball movie with Justin Timberlake and Amy Adams that was also supposed to be his last movie.
Where is the reddit version of Christopher Walken yelling for more upvotes

MORE UPVOTES
More about the character being a failure as a father and husband. His family life has had several ups and downs. 
Sometimes you don't even have to wait a year.
Seriously, it was like he ONLY made that movie as a tribute to them for their heroism, and his appreciation, not because he was trying to create some moving, Academy Award winning epic.

It's not nearly as bad as the critics make it out to be.
the movie is kinda hilarious too so it's got that going for it
That movie came out 7 months ago and it feels like a distant memory from YEARS ago
I think people are a bit unfair to it. The childhood segments are pretty insufferable, but once it gets to the guys playing themselves, I sort of admire how earnest and unapologetically uncool the whole thing is. It's kind of just these dudes reconstructing memories they had up until the train incident, and very little is done to dress anything else up as anything interesting or exciting. It just meanders around, but in a way I found weirdly entrancing. 
It was okay. Was it great? No. Just ok.
Hereafter?
American Sniper?

Gran Torino?

Flags of Our Fathers?

15:17 to Paris?
Sean Connery incapacitated? I thought he just wanted to stop acting, like Hackman, Pesci or Nicholson (even though Pesci is back and Nicholson was being asked to film again
yes.
I thought they were surpassed by the USPS.
It's only in spanish, that okay? 
Yeah, Torino is great for me for personal reasons I guess. Okay to good is where he has been operating for sure.
I thought it was good when I saw it and kinda forgot the movie. That doesn't really sit well for me.
Sully was a great short film with a much longer, less interesting film around it.
That movie is shit because it had that one scene with a doll. 

E: /s
Personally, it was decent. It had a great performance from Bradley and a good true story but the message of the film is half pro war and half anti-war. I have qualms with it 
Yea he's released at least 5 movies since 2011, not sure what that poster was talking about.
I think he's worried about Clint Eastwood, not the trailer.

Does nobody remember Clint Eastwood at the Republican National Convention angrily yelling at an empty chair?
Nothing in the trailer besides its relevance to the border. But Clint Eastwood is a staunch Republican and American Sniper was mostly Americaporn.
Holy shit watch more movies. 
One of the more efficient sure, but there's only a couple films of his that could really be considered great.
Awww thanks man! If you were sitting next to me I’d totally give you a bite :)
Username confirms lol
i would rather drive to the end of the block, than walk it.
I'm 3 and I still haven't learned to walk yet
That's awesome
Im rich what can I do to be the same as tarantino. EDIT: i meant eastwood
Ah okay. I wasn't being that serious. I just wouldn't have been surprised if I was right nor would I care really I guess.
It’s okay I believe you lessthan3 
For your honestly I will award you with precisely +1 upvote 😀
It's good to see Elrond and Denethor still getting on together.
The Bee's Knees is my favorite. A little pricey, but it's a fun little tapas place. Good drinks too. 

I haven't lived there in a couple years, I hope it's still around. 

My go to comfort food was the Tin Drum. I think that one is a small chain though, but I'm not sure. I miss their curry; always made me feel better. 


If you get a chance, check out Taqueria El Patron on Washington rd. They have the best tacos in the area by far. Dennis' is also amazing and is right on Tobacco rd.
Lol

Do you all need help? I just finished a music production degree. I also do a lot of voice over work. 
Is it true they hired a bunch of extra post-production folks to rush this out to awards season?  If you can't say, just wink.
The sound mix in the polka scene was SUPURB. My God, really well done. You captured a live show in a way that few movies (I’ve seen) have. 
Your dad tastes good.
I just love classical music, and hearing it in the trailer surprised me and I wanted to let anyone interested know about it! :)
26 years ago.
[deleted]
> and people thought that was the big swan song

And before Gran Torino, it was Million Dollar Baby.
I’m glad that wasn’t the big swan song. That movie sucked.
I'm very glad it wasn't.
I watched that movie recently for the first time, it was pretty good
He probably meant it when he said it but as time went on he was probably like "I still feel pretty good. I could do another". But he knows he's old so when he says that it very well likely could be his last.
I always get a little sad chuckle when I read his Wikipedia article and it lists his children as "Undetermined number, including:" followed by seven names.
It's pretty damn bad
the good critics liked it for the most part
Haven't seen American Sniper nor 15:17, but I love the other two as movies. 
I thought I'd heard somewhere that he has dementia or Alzheimer's
Connery retired nearly 20 years ago. I don't think he's in great health.
Yes!
Naw, it was alright because it had a middling message that was trying to be Anti-war but came off pro-war too.
He literally just had a movie come out in February.
Everyone remembers it and it has unfairly painted, for some people, everything Eastwood has done since.  I also remember him majorly pissing off the GOP with "Million Dollar Baby," making an extremely humanistic war movie in "Letters From Iwo Jima" and making a lot of movies that are pretty clear in their depictions of violence being an awful thing (including, I would say, "American Sniper").
American Sniper told the true story of a staunch republican (Kyle) and his opinion on this country and the war on terror. But it was hardly a whitewashed view of these wars. It was shown to be as fucked up as you would expect it to be. 

Is there another example of Eastwood pushing “American propaganda” through his films that you can give? People are allowed to be republican and not be to the right of Rush Limbaugh
Just his opinion though. 
You mean Eastwood? 
Tin Drum is gone but the Bees Knees is still there. Things have changed a lot, but the whole down town area is going to transform once the cyber center is open.
I believe the guy this story is based on is from Michigan. I’m not looking too deep into the real facts until I see this.
Sorry but we’re all crewed up at the moment. Best of luck out there, tons of content being created, find your niche.

Same. So. Same. I’m the biggest old man Clint fan and I’m so excited for the mule
I watched some retrospective special on 60 Minutes and Steve Kroft said when he asked Clint about this he got a little scared for a moment because he got the classic Clint stare before he answered.
The Russian Critics hated it.
I understood it as "connery stopped acting because he was incapacitated" rather than "connery stopped working, and now is incapacitated so even if he wanted to come back, he can't"

taraaaaaaaaa
Also because the whole sniper vs sniper subplot and the ending seemed from a Call of Duty game.
I love Clint Eastwood films but doesn't mean I like the guy.  He's pretty much said he hates all people under 50, made a mockery of our first black president for no reason, and is a Trumper.

I'll still see whatever he puts out though, unless it's a fucking musical or he's casting people who have never acted before (although that movie was pretty unintentionally hilarious).  
>true story 

Wasn't it true that the author was a big liar?
I actually thought the movie did a very poor job if conveying any opinion about the war. It was mostly a montage of Americana culture and a sniper saving the day. 
Yeah hahaha its 4am here and ive been on r/movies too long
PRO TOOLS ALL DAY EVERY DAY! That Post Production Life
Is this the final color grade? Really sick of seeing digital movies just keep the green LOG look.
> I love Clint Eastwood films but doesn't mean I like the guy.

Certainly.  I'm just saying that I think people wrongly make a lot of assumptions about the politics of his movies specifically because of the chair thing.  He has expressed (and shown in his movies) other views that go against typical right wing politics.


What?
I don't think it shows that at all.
The answer is have access to better healthcare from better doctors. The ability to afford healthy food. Not saying less stress but a lot of lower class jobs involve repetitive back breaking labor. Please take note I’m not. Saying Eastwood or yourself doesn’t deserve the wealth you or him have. I’m just noting why a normal person might not be as healthy as a higher class person. 
Could be be worse, could be one of the myriad of SHIT DAWs I had to use from '89-'98. At least it isn't a Fairlight or DAWN, those were CRAP!
oh absolutely, gran torino was about a Trumper type guy who falls in love with an immigrant family.

he doesn't even write the scripts either so ... the main themes of the stories aren't his creations.  Although obviously as a director you have ahuge influence
The author was found to be a big liar.

Jessie Ventura successfully sued he's estate for libel/slander and in his book he claims to have shot dozens of looters during Katrina which is downright silly.
I think there was one very interesting scene that everyone seems to overlook.

He meets his little brother coming home from a tour.  His brother is like 'this war is bullshit' and Chris Kyle literally can't fathom what his brother is saying to him.  He just looks at him confused as he walks away.

I saw American Sniper as a movie about addiction, in this case it was an addiction to war and his job.  I have no idea if that was the intention (probably not), but that's how I chose to view it.  I thought it was good shit.  
You need to visit a few Chinatown neighborhoods around 6 am. 
oh. you dont need to be rich for that tbh. This is pretty standard for most first world countries (except the us for healthcare which im guessing ur from).
Beats laying bricks 
I think that's as valid an interpretation as any other, and certainly the scene you mention was included for a reason.  Personally, I see it mainly as being about a person who from a young age was taught that violence and might is the way to solve issues (we see this both during the dinner table scene with his brother, as well as how he deals with the infidelity of his girlfriend).  The military then uses that violent tendency and fighting spirit and basically spits him out a broken man.
I liked the portrayal of our military and the servicemen and women therein for most of the film, but I thought the credits really undermined what Eastwood seemed to be getting at, distilling the story of Kyle to "🇺🇸wow 🇺🇸 what 🇺🇸 a 🇺🇸 patriot. 🇺🇸"

Muddled what I thought Eastwood's intent even was. Very excited for this, though.
Why?
So you’re skipping the labor part of my message. That’s cool. Yes I’m from the US. 
everyone says war movies romanticize war but I don't think I've seen one war film that does that, except maybe like Braveheart or ... Gladiator?  All modern war films make it seem like pure hell.
Pretty much, although I'd say the movie portrays him as a changed man for the better in the end, since he ended up leaving his rifle behind, something his dad told him never to do at the beginning of the movie. 

It is like the Walking Dead, except they all are doing Tai Chi. 
i wasnt ignoring. i can go further explanation on all points if you want but most people (again most) where im from, work retail or in an office or in the food industry etc so not really repetitive back breaking labor.
