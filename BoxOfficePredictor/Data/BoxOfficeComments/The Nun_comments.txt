Easiest demon to defeat just say its name, it will even give it to you if you ask nicely. 
horror movie trailer, ‚Äúmake sure you watch to the end‚Äù man I wonder what‚Äôs gonna happen
Taissa Farmiga takes the lead. Wonder if they'll bridge a connection between her character and Vera Farmiga's character in the other Conjuring films.
Definitely looks kinda generic, but if done well, this is what works for me. I mean The Conjuring wasn't groundbreaking, but the execution was spot on and that's why I loved it. 
I'm a big fan of the Conjuring universe movies, Annabelle 1 was the weakest but still had its moments. Valak was best part of the second Conjuring movie, so I'm excited for this. 
I was certain the nun behind her to suddenly grab her, but damn the jumpscare got me. 
Man that jump scare at the end was goofy as hell. Got a solid chuckle out of me.
I just hope it does well enough for anothet spinoff: *Nundercover.*
I'm confused as to why this isn't a full trailer. I hope they put in the effort to actually give this character a real backstory. Annabelle: Creation was a very solid prequel so I'm expecting the same from this one. Appears to be wonderfully done as per usual, the fact that none of these movies are set in present day helps them a lot I think. As a horror fan I also choose to support them because they're among the very few horror movies these days that actually get a budget. While horror directors are some of the best at making the most of what they have, I wish more horror movies today had those same means.

When it told me to watch till the end I was expecting some post credit type stinger, but no. So why even have that there?

My reaction to the second nun jump scare at the end: "Clever girl."
I really like the stylized visuals in some of the shots. 

Cool time period/setting to do a horror in.
Fuck everything about that painting
That creepy starting music 
I love how these horror movies are allowing younger less experienced directors have a shot at the big screen. I'm not saying this director is not good because of lack of experience I just like giving younger blood the opportunity to show what their capable of.
I don‚Äôt know about this movie though but this nun is one of the few things that actually scared me in horror movies. If executed well, it‚Äôs gonna be a crazy ride.
I lived in Romania for two years and have been to that castle THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE FUCKING LIT
Love this. It actually looks beautifully shot.

I'm really enjoying this burgeoning Conjuring universe. It's working surprisingly well! (Actually, it's the only "connected" universe working outside of Marvel nowadays!)
The only nun movie I want to see is between Toby McGuire and Robert Downey Jr 
Please release Aquaman trailer too
As someone who has enjoyed the whole 'Conjuring' verse movies (yes, even the first Annabelle) I'm super excited for this one.
Guys...would anybody explain me what did that guy said at the end...I couldn't get it...anybody explain it pls.
The Nun was staring into my soul.
Horrible idea to watch this before going to bed. Fuck.
Not overly impressed yet. I'm surprised that a movie coming out in like 3 months only has this short 1 minute 33 second teaser.
Are the Farmiga sisters the go to ‚Äúscream queens‚Äù in Hollywood or something (not that I‚Äôm complaining)
Alright, I‚Äôm no horror movie expert but if a priest asks you to ‚Äòaccompany him to Romania‚Äô you should probably say ‚Äúno‚Äù.
NU–ò  
Trent Reznor is going through some weird rebranding.
I hope they save all the actual scares for the movie. I don't want the trailer to spoil every scary part.
I knew a jump scare was imminent. They still got me.
I hope that other nun was a good ghost. So many of these movies never have any good super natural presence. The only thing that bothers with that is the show, Supernatural.

it doesn't need to be some powerful entity, but just something that can at least try to help. Insidious also did this a little bit. I just hate that when demons are involved, they never bother to have angels or God involved. not in some religious message way, but it's like, if demons exist, then the other side should exist as well. I think it can still be scary with that element added.
clever nun
Actual nuns thinking well we had a good run time to pack it up pack it in.
i'm guessing it won't break new ground but completely smash the current one its on already. the previous films weren't genre defining but they were definitely good horror/jumpscare films in their own right. 

The end of the trailer scared the fuck out of me.

I was like meh, its gonna grab her.

Then a different one showed up, velociraptoring the poor girl.
I want to be hyped for this but the demon nun reminds me of Nosferatu from Spongebob.

*flicks light switch rapidly*
this season of american horror story looks good
Finally, the answer to the question on *everyone's* mind:  Who was than nun that showed up for 2 seconds in The Conjuring movies?
Now that I think of it, there should be a lot more horror movies about nuns.

Source: 16 years of Catholic school
Not a big fan of jumpscares...but I liked this one üòÅ
Ever since I watched hereditary nothing phases me anymore
The Nun ‚Äî Featuring the bus driver!
woah if u pause the screen at 0:16 and scroll up and down on your computer screen the nun's face fades in and out like a hologram. Damn
Really like the look of this movie!  I am completely on board!
[deleted]
[deleted]
It‚Äôs a solid trailer. Hopefully they don‚Äôt give away much more footage. I‚Äôve been sold on this movie ever since it was announced so I‚Äôm good haha
pls no 2 skehwee 
I'm pretty excited for this. My only concern is the director is a bit green. James wan did a good job picking the director for annabelle 2/Lights out, so homefully he had a hand in doing this. 
this actually looks better than i thought, the setting looks really cool. Hope its not just a jump scare fest
IM SO PISSED THIS SHOWED UP BEFORE I SAW TAG ALONE....
Jump scares are pretty bullshit and having a trailer on youtube where its nothing but a screamer shows your movie is garbage.
i mean this looks awful but i like horror movies set in the past.
Fucking jump scares.  smh
This looks pretty generic and far too reliant on the fact that the creators think that we should find the look of a nun scary..  

I hope that I am proven wrong and that there is depth to this, but as someone who didn't like The Conjuring 2, looks like more of the same to me.

edited to add: Holy shit did the studio really have such little faith in the attention span of their audiences that they put a message at the start saying "make sure you watch to the end"..  in the process also giving away that there would be a scare to close the trailer? What a strange thing to do. 
OH NO A JUMPSCARE WITH A LOUD NOISE I'M SO SPOOOOKED
HEY! Can‚Äôt you see this woman is a nUN?? 
Won't watch the trailer cuz it will spoil a jump scare.
What does he say after she says "what?" at 0:44? "Chinny het dam"?
That nonconsensual 2nd base grope 
I kinda wish this movie would be like a weird mix of 'Harry Potter' and 'The Exorcist'. I mean, this girl is like a novitiate, right? She's learning all this stuff about being a nun and her vision, the how and the why it's so dangerous. And there's the guy who's a priest like being her guide the way Dumbledore did to Harry. They all have these character traits and are so relatable. The new girl having a traumatic past and the priest dealing with some sort of demons (including humans). Maybe throw in some engaging side characters (The Conjuring movies are a pro at this). And the mystery of it all, is how they're linked together to something bigger other than the attack on their faith. Maybe I'm expecting too much, but so far I'm hyped!Ôªø
Why the fuck would I want to watch this?
The painting looks like a painting of Will Farrell dressed as a nun.
You know why they call them Nuns? Because they get none.
another predictable and cheesy jumpscares movie, ugh
"I was asked to accompany a priest to an abbaye in Romania"

Common sense answer :

"Nah I'm good here, thanks though !"
Looks alright. I like the setting in Transylvania and I'm very excited for the score of Abel Korzeniowski. His work for Nocturnal Animals is exquisite! 
Who was that Callihan person they mention in the trailer midway through?  They say it like it's some kind of big deal and I was just left ???
Same old shit. 
This trailer looked... ok at first. Then it got genuinely creepy towards the end... THEN THEY FUCKED IT UP WITH A CHEAP JUMPSCARE. I am still interested in seeing It, but I am highly sceptical.
That will win Best Picture of the Year at the Academy Awards. I have a good intuition about these things. 
Inb4 creepy nun from the Conjuring is actually the protagonist of this movie. 
Very excited for Taissa. I'm a big fan of American Horror Story and she is definitely an underrated recurring cast member. [The scene where she finds her dead body was so good.](/spoiler)
the line to watch the end made me too scared to watch the whole thing . lol true story.
Pass
The trailer is scarier than all of hereditary 
A nun, but she's a bad nun!

Sooooo a Nun?

Edit: People downvoting me forget that Nuns help cover up child molestation and abuse...but hey, they look like they care.
Gotta say I‚Äôm really bored with these movies, even when well executed.  I find movies that mess your perception and expectation of safety in everyday life more terrifying.  Oh surprise, she‚Äôs in a dark hallway and monster jumped out.... the first thing that pops into my head is - why would the monster wait? It‚Äôs supposedly all bloodthirsty but now it‚Äôs patient? It‚Äôs just like somebody took the plot to a scooby doo episode and made the monsters a little more adult.  When I finish watching movies like this I‚Äôm left thinking, do all ghosts and demons have the brain of a 5 year old that just took an edible? You have supernatural powers and the best you can do is jump out of a fucking shadow? Great job.  

Best example I can give would be the police office scene from Babadook.   All kinds of nope. 

I feel like the recent IT did this well too.  You never knew when they were being fucked with till it was too late. 
Yawn
Don't bother watching to the end.
I was able to predict everything that was going to happen in this teaser 
Looks promising however I'm really sure it'll be an average movie like the last Annabelle movie.  Hopefully it doesnt rely on cheap jump scares or boring.

That jump scary at the end got me lol. 
I like Taissa Farmiga but this looks pretty meh. 
I worry this isn‚Äôt going to be very good. The set looked really fake and the fog machine fog on the floor screams of trying too hard to be creepy. Red flags for sure. I hope I‚Äôm wrong. 
is this going to be another movie like that horrible Annabelle movie that came out last year where the nun/evil doll/demon/whatever never actually does anything to the characters, no one dies, they exist only to create "cool" jump scare moments and startle the audience. I swear the last Annabelle movie was that, start and stop through the whole movie. Corin Hardy is at least a bit too good to be doing diet James Wan, I thought The Hallow was a pretty good and unique movie.
The conjuring 2 was pretty lame. I think Brian Warner could pull off acting as a nun pretty well so who knows. 
Man, horror movies of the past 10-20 years SUCKkkkkkkkk.  With exception to the the It remake. 

Edit: forgot about ‚ÄúA Quiet Place‚Äù. 
These movies become a dark comedy if you aren't don't believe in the whole religion side of this. It just becomes about a super natural being that dresses up as a nun to fuck with a man and his wife at their jobs. 
Looks like Jump Scare - the Movie.  
Teaches you nothing about the lore.  
Where is the connection?  
Some hot Nun had some nightmares so the church sends her somewhere creepy?  

Pray for forgiveness I‚Äôm sure was the caption for the spoof movie Ewen McGregor did at the beginning of dodge ball maybe...  I‚Äôm rambling..... into nothingness 
So why doesn't the demon go after people who are mute, dyslexic or stutter? Does a very thick accent count when you say the name? "V√§l√§k!" Demon: "What?!". Does the name count in written form? Just wear a t-shirt with Valak on it. Can you go into a haunted location with a Ghettoblaster playing the recording of someone saying the name? Can the demon wear earplugs? What if the demon was distracted and didn't hear you? "valak" "Sorry, what did you say?" "VALAK!" "aw shit". 

Kinda like what Eddie Izzard said on vampires 

https://youtu.be/3QGhSYgPhgA?t=1m30s
.... give it to you? 
Got a release date that didn't jump out at me, whew, that was close.  I was waiting for the jump scare at the end, but it never came.  Lucky me.
Is this a new breed of clickbait they've discovered?
idk what was supposed to happen was the nun charge the thing or was there more that i missed ?
I was planning on watching the whole trailer, but when i saw that i closed it. Dont tell me what to do, movie trailer.
"Also make sure to like and subscribe"
She's gonna execute a 32 Belly Option on 2 on 2, READY?
Probably avengers after credit scene at this point.
I thiiiink they do that in case you get the trailer as an ad before a youtube video
I thought they were gonna do something unique because of that line. Nope, same old cliche. 
I think that is a safe assumption. Valak takes a big interest in Lorraine above all in C2 for whatever reason.
Given the age difference I thought Taissa was Vera's daughter, but she's actually a sibling. Pretty huge sibling age difference of 21 years. 
taissa farmiga's character is vera farmiga's mother... imagine that

People forget just how generic The Conjuring was - family moving into old haunted home, dog that gets upset and won't go in, little girl with imaginary friend that's obviously a ghost, piano that plays by itself, birds killing themselves by hitting the windows, etc. The plot rested on clich√© after clich√© but it worked because like you say, the execution was great.

A good director can make even the oldest tropes scary again and apart from the first Annabelle movie, this franchise has a pretty great track record. Fully expecting the Nun to be a clich√©d but thoroughly enjoyable horror flick.
And that guitar scene really made the characters work. 
I loved Annabelle 1 cause it included one of my biggest fears, turning around and seeing a monster at the bottom of the stairs
yep, that was the point 
It actually got me, I'm ashamed to say. 
I was not expecting that and almost fell off my chair.
Good usage of misdirection with that first nun in the back.
Exorcist III vibes
Maybe I‚Äôm just jumpier  than the average person but that legit gave me goose bumps! I can totally see how it comes across as cheesy though. 
It makes me want to say, "Nice prank!"
I can understand not getting spooked but I could never get a chuckle out of such scenes. Maybe I'm just a bitch xD
This is supposed to be the darkest installment of the Sister Act series 
With horror films im ok with shorter trailers or just teasers. We don't want to see every scare, and part of horror is being surprised. Otherwise you get those other horror trailers where every good scare is revealed and so when you see it nothing scares or surprises you anymore.
So, that's it, huh? We're some kind of Pope Squad.
That Nun painting scene in the Conjuring 2 was the most scary damm thing I've scene in my life.  The whole theater went nuts.
Considering we just got Hereditary from what I believe was a first time director I definitely think this approach is working!
I agree, Corin Hardy seems to be a great guy and I liked his movie The Hallow and the use of practical effects... I just hope he was able to make his ideas instead of the studio (or writer) taking over.
In my honest opinion that nun is the creepiest horror creature I have ever seen. The scenes with it in The Conjuring 2 were just so damn unnerving!
where in romania is that castle?
Cloverfield, Unbreakable
The Kong universe is also working well
I really hope they do soon, I'm getting kinda impatient with them taking such a long time.
Word is that they're trying to sneak it in front of Jurassic World 2 and Ant-Man, so I'd imagine it'd be put online in the next day or two, if not today
I'm guessing tomorrow or Friday
Not trying to be a smart ass but are people actually excited for more DC stuff? I haven‚Äôt seen any of them beyond man of Steel and maybe 20 minutes of the Batman one, but I thought justice league was supposed to be terrible right? Wouldn‚Äôt this just be a more fleshed out version of that?
He reads the inscription on the door and says what I think is "God ends here". I may be wrong though.
Remember to tuck in your feet!
I watched the Conjuring 2 when I was home from college for a weekend. That nun made sleeping in my cleaned out former-bedroom-turned-parents-new-storage-area a real bitch.
what ? you'll have a buddy to sleep wit mang    
sure its a demony demon hungry for your soul and sanity but hey maybe if you ask nicely it'll let you be the big spoon üòè
I'm kinda hoping for it to stay that way. We get these crazy long trailers nowadays that really take away from most films. I'd be way more excited to see it if they only released 1 more trailer of this same length, rather than a couple more 3 minute trailers. I've taken to only watching a single trailer until I'm interested, then stopping it and not watching anything further until the actual movie. It has really made watching new movies much more fun.
Doesn't help his new album is called Bad Witch
Well the trailer is so short there is no danger of that so far :)
*dies*
You'r an exorcist Havvy!
hmm not really, i think its just James Wan trying to make a cinematic horror universe around objects/characters and happenings from the original Conjuring. 
GET SPOOPED BITCH WAA
you were correct!
Nice try, Greg Turkington!
Agreed, hereditary sucked.
Yep!
Hereditary kicked ass. It's love it or hate it but if you love it you fucking love it, and I fucking loved it.
It Follows is great!
That's quite an unfair generalization to make about twenty years worth of movies. If you're only looking at movies that have received wide theatrical releases, you're missing out on a ton of horror movies which are some of the best in recent memory. There are plenty of subperb foreign horror films too. 
There is much more out there than what plays at your local theatre. 
It's literally a 1 minute teaser....you expected them to get into the lore???
I agree.  

Dude wanna go see Jump Scare 8!?!? I heard you see the nuns titties when she‚Äôs running from the monster!!!

Somewhere a dead horse is shedding a tear for this movie formula.  
My head cannon for these kinds of things in movies is that evil things are compelled to 'follow the rules.' 

You have to remember that in the Judao-Christian mythology, man is given free will by God. But angels and demons are products of Heaven, so there is nothing mentioned about them being able to make their own decisions. And demons are twisted, fallen versions of Heaven's servants, so even though they are evil, there's still a part of them that is compelled to follow the rules of Heaven, which would mean they can only interfere/attack us in certain ways?

It could also be that taking mutes and such wouldn't be a challenge- the pleasure they take from our suffering is doubly so *because* they can take us. We have free will and manipulating us to die is so much sweeter. It may be a 'badge of honor' thing among demons- perhaps demons who try to take mutes and disabled people are mocked or looked down on because it's too easy. 


Yea I always accidentally miss the last little bit of trailers after the date and text stuff, so I was like "okay trailer, I *will* just because you asked and I usually forget" and then there was literally nothing. Worst. Trailer. Ever. (jk I'd watch it)
It's like bitcoin mining. Everyone is trying to find the next clickbait
I think that was it. Thank God they included the disclaimer or I would‚Äôve stopped watching a 90 second movie trailer before it ended.
The Valak painting is still more creepy.
r/firstworldanarchists
I'd be interested to see if it worked. The 5 second skip is a real killer for ads.
Exactly what I was thinking. I just hope *this* isn't the big spoiler (or rather, the only big spoiler) that comes with the film.
Vera is 2nd oldest and Taissa is the youngest of 7 siblings!
Valak must be hella scary if she could turn a sister into a mother
According to Wikipedia, The Nun takes place in 1952, so that seems unlikely.
‚ÄúIt's not what a movie is about, it's how it is about it.‚Äù

‚Äï Roger Ebert
Yeah, absolutely. There's a reason things become generic, it's because they work. For me, I react the best (=most scared) to all the good old stuff. No matter how many times it's used, if the atmosphere is right, a creaking floorboard or a door mysteriously opening itself are fantastic. 


I'm someone who has seen hundreds of movies and can see jump scares coming a mile away. But the Conjuring was so excellent at execution that the scariest part of the movie for me was a total surprise and the whole theater jumped when it happened. I'm talking about the basement clapping scene as her matches keep dying out. 99.99% of horror movies would've had something loud and scary coming up the stairs in the darkness but in the Conjuring, the suspense was built so well that all it took was two human hands appearing behind her next to her ears and clapping twice to make me jump. Damn, I love that movie.
The thing that makes the series special is the b-plots. The ghosts and demons are fun but the wholesome husband and wife with a good marriage rescuing a family that has fallen on hard times is what gives it a wider appeal. It's similar to the "family" thing in the Fast and Furious franchise. Cars and demons are cool but relatable human relationships are what people cling to.
I couldn't get past all of the basic shit that was going on in that movie. It was so boring. It's one of the only movies I can think of that got great reviews and I completely couldn't understand why.
Yeah one of the things I like about this series is the Warrens actually seem like real people.  Sure the movies can be silly and jump-scary at times but at least I kinda care about the main characters.
Patrick Wilson has been great in The Conjuring series, guitar scene was such a great touch.
Me too, but I'm a pussy when it comes to this stuff so it was inevitable.
Fucking hell, me too.
It got me too but I still laughed. 
For better or worse, the Conjuring/Insidious series of films rely heavily on jump scares. They usually do it pretty well, so I don't mind. Some say jump scares are cheap, but it makes these movies a bit of a thrill ride.

I mean, the face scene in Insidious is going to go down in horror film history. 
Dont be ashamed. Its not actually scary and its why modern "horror" is terrible. It just relies on blasting a sound in your ear so the stupid "scare" makes you jump. 
Jump scared are a survival reaction dw
Reminded me of [this](https://youtu.be/B0fm2lRrEg0).
Nuns are actually quite efficient and intelligent pack hunters. The unseen nun is the deadliest. 
It was kinda clever but having the next nun just charge at her like that was silly. All you need to do is have it so when she turns to greet the first one, the second one is illuminated by the lamp and shown to be right next to her. Boom. Simple as that.
The jurrassic park raptor since came to mind when I saw that.
Knew it felt familiar 
As soon as she was walking down the hall I was thinking Exorcist 3.  

I still prefer more subtle jump scares tho.
Yeah pretty neat homage 
Great movie btw that scene where that statue in the church is smiling like the joker got me creepy shit
That's a nunderstatement
Agreed. I saw Hereditary this past weekend and was blown away by how little was given away in the trailers.
Corvin‚Äôs Castle in Hunedoara. 
What's insane is that they waited so long yet now we are getting a trailer and we are definitely getting more footage in 5 weeks at Comic Con
That‚Äôs a *terrible* idea.
Maybe you should give up a lot earlier, like 1997 when Batman and Robin comes out
Most people liked Wonder Woman, and Aquaman seemed like missed potential in JL, so that's probably why. 
yep! he says dat!
U r correct...now I get it...thank u so much man.
It was written on the door...but...thanks for ur effort...he says that something is here...I don't know what's that here...thank u.
Shut up mate. My imagination is already running bloody wild.
If it gets me, I don't have to pay my mortgage anymore. It's really pretty even handed. 
Remember to cum!
I‚Äôve decided this will be the first and only trailer/clip I‚Äôll see to avoid any spoilers. Takes the fun out of jump scares when I know when to expect them haha
The movie was AMAZING even if it wasn't scary. I actually a few days later find the movie constantly on my mind. Some of those images in the movie are just seared into my brain now...
A little bit more than they did.  Yeah I do.  Otherwise you‚Äôre just selling the movie based on its predecessor and some cheap jump scares. 
Anything except some bland, unbelievable backstory with an unrealistic hot young actress in a Nun costume.  
It told me nothing.  Is she a demon?  A monster?  Was she attacked and turned evil?  Why is she so ominous?  

So Valak and the Predator follow an honor system for worthy prey. Crossover please.
Well, as far as I understand it angels and demons do have free will. Satan was technically an angel and he chose to fall. Otherwise it opens a whole can of worms as it would mean God created satan and demons. Obviously the topic could be discussed to death, but here's my understanding:

Angels were created free will

Since they had free will, some chose to fall.

God and angels/demons exist outside of time

Change requires time

Therefore, even though angels have free will, they cannot change and are essentially locked into whatever choice they made at the "moment" of their creation. 
That is some interesting head cannon. Take my upvote.
[head cannon] (https://imgur.com/gallery/mtSiu)
According to the story though the fallen angels made a clear choice to rebel, so that doesn't pair up.
> compelled to follow the rules of Heaven, which would mean they can only interfere/attack us in certain ways

But why would Heaven even have rules that allow their entities to attack us? That's not making sense to me. I always imagined it as a very peaceful/blissful place. They shouldn't have any rules about attacking anybody right?
well that was lame ....   
i mean i wasn't expecting her to come an tickle ma balls    
but still  
Papa Varmiga sure is busy.
That's what I dislike about a lot of modern movie critics. My girlfriend always sends me reviews from the Guardian and it always seems to be pompous bullshit. Siskel and Ebert could sometimes miss the mark but they wouldn't review a cheese burger like it was a Ribeye. 
Unfortunately trailers spoiled that scene for me before hand. That wardrobe scene on the other hand, oh boy...

Movie did terrify the SHIT out of me though and seeing that movie at a midnight premiere was not only the scariest movie experience I have ever had, but also one of he best movie theater experiences I have had.
Some of the moments with the Warrens is great, but more often than not they feel *very* hokey, and I think  the music doesn't help. Wan and Bishara do great horror stuff, but they are not so great when it comes time for the human parts... (and god damn it I hate Whannel's 3rd act writing in the Insidious series)

...that said I love the movies, they're some of my favs\-\- though Hereditary has easily usurped their place as my favorite horror film of the decade.
Totally agree. He's great in pretty much everything. 
He literally turns into a christian superhero and I love it
Nothing pussy about reacting naturally to a loud unexpected noise.
is your username a hotfuzz reference?
the one with darth maul behind wilson?
[deleted]
jump scares have always been a part of horror, there's a difference between a good jump scare and a bad one. I'm sure this scene would have been just a creepy without the noise. 
Apparently I am very strict to what I consider a jumpscare. at the end of the reboot of IT I was like "wow, they really didn't rely on many jump scares at all!" only to come on the internet and read about how it was all jump scares.   
This one got me tho.
It's also really uncreative. Nothing behind her, the camera pans down the hall to show nothing, then back to her and now something is. Seen it a hundred times.
You think hereditary was scary. Be quiet 
Goddamn what game is that?
Clever girl... 
Yeah I was a bit more perturbed by the faceless nun following her than the jump scare.
No. You need a loud noise to show that it is scary. Otherwise, it's not a horror!
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that simple brah. I don‚Äôt think it would have anywhere near the same effect. You are pitching something an indie horror would do - this is trying to make people jump not just have a moment of dread. Jump scares are what mainstream horror fans come for along with the dread
That would be perfect!  And no loud noise either.
Yesss, nuns hunt in packs. Maybe they'll evolve to open doors ^to^heaven^!
You really can't have a subtle jump scare. They are, by definition, unsubtle.
You mean that shitty slow burn that put me to sleep lol
Just googled it, man that place looks creepy.

Rubber lips baby!
lol dude has an honest question and gets treated with snark. the only dceu film i'm excited for is aquaman and its only bcuz of james wan. the management of these films, save for ww, shows no promise of a ship being righted in the near future
No problem
Did you hear that sound on the corridor? ^hoping ^you ^have ^a ^corridor 
She'll grab your ankles when you get out of bed tomorrow morning. Sleep tight.
> It told me nothing.

Yeah, well I'm sure that will be in the actual movie. It's a fucking teaser dude. Teasers just set up the vibe and basics. 
Both are getting a movie this September ü§î
Alien vs Predator vs Terminator vs The Nun vs Freddy vs Jason : Dawn of Justice 
Bad guys do love honor, in movies they attack the hero one at a time. 
Satan/Lucifer didn't *choose* to fall, he was cast out of Heaven for questioning God, which is a pretty strong argument that angels *don't* have free will. His blatant disregard for the rules was what got him in trouble in the first place.

And one could argue that it was part of 'God's Will' that he did it, since God needs an adversary. God intended for him to break the rules, or foresaw it happening, or made him that way. Whatever, still a dick move.
Which would indicate that they aren't supposed to have free will, i.e., questioning/rebelling got them in a lot of trouble. And (still head cannon), after falling and turning into demons/evil things, the rules are even stricter now as punishment?
>  i wasn't expecting her to come an tickle ma balls

But they put the words "Nun" and "teaser" so close together in the title.
L M A O O O O
> review a cheese burger like it was a Ribeye.

I'm using this, thank you. 
Well, most opinion articles online are just written by random people. It's like a random redditor writing a longer version of a comment and we're all suppose to take it more seriously than the rest. 
>reviews from the Guardian

There's your issue

Yep. The Conjuring was the last horror trailer I watched. I'm eternally thankful I never watched or read anything about Hereditary. I watched the trailer after and couldn't believe they showed certain major scenes. 
It's reasons like that I don't watch trailers anymore. I'll read the synopsis and if it has a good rating I'll check it out.
How did Joseph Bishara come into the picture? The Composer?
It is! :D
You should try contributing next time.
No. It wouldn't. People discredit the influence and importance good audio makes. In sound effects, in music, everything. They can be at times more important than the visuals. Because what you hear can fundamentally alter how you perceive the scene. The wrong tone or music and something scary becomes comical. Something emotional becomes boring.

In this case the "scare" more happens from your ears being assaulted by an abrupt awful noise. That's their structure. They depend on being abrupt and loud when unexpected. Though the formula is so predictable it's now instantly expected, making it nowhere near as effective as it used to be. Oh there's a 10 second quiet scene? Better plug my ears before the movie decides they need to hurt.
Clearly the director wants you to predict the sudden appearance of nun #1 so that you _don't_ predict the appearance of nun #2. It's misdirection, and it works fairly well.

Granted, it's also stupid. Since the woman doesn't know about either nun, it seems like wasted energy to double-nun like that.  I suppose the nun wants to impress us, the audience. Nuns are needy like that.
Did I watch a different trailer?  That wasn't what happened.  It was a misdirect that turned the cliche jump scare you're describing on it's head.  It was pretty clever, imo.  
there was an actual jump scare after that.
huh
Layers of Fear, it's also free on Steam at the moment for a few days.
If there isn't a scene in this movie where a nun comes from the side and eats a character, I will be very dissapointed
Any good horror movie uses both
>Jump scares are what mainstream horror fans come for

Stop depressing me
I mean ones where it isn't blatant or forced.

Like the creature is there the whole time, you just don't see that it is until it moves.  Maybe some people see it sooner than others, maybe the jump part can even be experienced at different times by different people based on how quickly they notice what it is they are really seeing.

Not a smash cut with music spike.
Sorry you didn't like it! I personally really enjoyed it, but I can see how some people might not.
Shut the fuck up cunt. Just the notification noise from these messages gets my heart going.

ITS THE ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN

Let me know once you perfect the ribeye burger. It's been a dream of mine for years. 
That scene is a PERFECTLY done scare. It is one of those scenes that I think should be broken down and used as an example of how to set up a scary scene.
IDK I watched a trailer or two for Hereditary and felt like I knew nothing of what the movie would be going in.
I like watching trailers but you definitely have to be careful about bad trailers that spoil shit.
Yes, the composer. He's superb with his horror strings, but when it comes time for the feel\-good stuff, the piano just clashes a bit too hard\-\- then again that's partly the writing, but neither are too egregious, just the weakest parts of them, imo. Again, still some of my favorite movies, just have their faults in certain areas.
When i used the word "Creepy" i meant "creepy" not scary, there's a pretty big difference. A movie doesn't need sound to be creepy. I'm talking about those jump scares that aren't scary without the sound, like someone reaching out an arm only to discover it's their friend. Those are the examples where jump scares are unnecessary, i have no issue with "spooky" scenes having loud noises, as long as it's used correctly and isn't overdone.  
Do you get to keep the game for free after the few days are over?
Why is that depressing? They come for the thrill ride and rollercoaster.
I call those ‚Äúwet scares‚Äù
That's not a jump scare that you just pitched
*Boooo!*
Featuring Badger and Snake. 
Holy fuck that song/video takes me waaaaaaaaaaaay back to my early days on the internet

Just make sure you don't stare too long at the dark corners of your room,  they hate it when you do that.  :)
