Was I the only one expecting Johnny Depp to pop up at some point?
>The time has come...

For the Nutcrackers to end.
MURPH!

Ready for the Rat King to terrify an entire generation of children.
I had no idea they were making this. Disney has soured me just as much as anyone with all the live action remakes, but I'm into this. Visually stunning, an original story (an adaptation, but at least not a sequel or remake), a lovely score, and a solid cast (that's not The Rock or Josh Gad). Hope this one is good.
I like the ominous tone when "From Disney" appears. Very appropriate.
No wonder she looks so familiar, it's the creepy CGI girl from twilight
I look forward to all of my dancer friends complaining to me about how horrible all of the celebrities are at ballet!
Keira Knightley reminds me of Effie Trinket in this Trailer.
This style of movie is getting so old. I closed the trailer halfway through. Zzzzz
Well that looks gorgeous if nothing else. I'm sure my kids will love it.

It does point out something about some of the more recent live action Disney films though. They all have really striking visuals but sharing them with previous animated films detracts. Since this is entirely original for Disney the aesthetic seems to stick out a lot more in a very positive way. 
The whole thing look pretty generic (beside the quick node to Fantasia https://imgur.com/a/bAb5H)
Reminds me of Cinderella 2015. I hope this one is at least half as good.
Reminds me a lot of the Tim Burton Alice in Wonderland 
I thought this was going to be animated :(
Tchaikovsky plus morgan freeman doesn’t sound too bad to me
It's great to get another Disney movie based on classical music. Sort of a live action Fantasia.
Why do I get the horrifying sense that half this movie might wind up being "world-building" that's irrelevant to the plot, but trying to build up some "nutcracker universe" Disney will try and milk for decades to come. 

"Coming NEXT christmas: Sugar Plum Fairies: The Revenge! Followed by Rat King: Origins"
This looks like the same shitty CGI-fest that Alice in Wonderland and all the other live action Disney Princess movies had.
You had me at Keira Knightly 
Getting a serious Chronicles of Narnia theme from this. 
Give me a trailer for "Wreck-It Ralph 2", Disney!
This movie is gonna make so much fucking money 
A dark side? Why must everything be gritty?
Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman got some strange costumes.
Looks fun, I like that actress from Interstellar, she was great in that. And nice visuals, things didn't look to fake-ish to me. Also

* Long Haired Hare (LEOPOLD)

* 65mm masterraceee
Holy shit I am so on board for this. Shut up and take my money, Disney. 
ITT: salty motherfuckers that forgot what it's like to be a kid and criticizing a kid's movie made for kids.

There's nothing wrong with this. Kids are going to love it. 
inception horn starting at 1:06 can't unhear
https://youtu.be/2ktuvx9hrMw?t=65
What the heck is Morgan Freeman wearing?

Looks like a rejected pirate from Peter Pan.
Man, Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies is so damn good.
I'm not sure there's ever been a true live action narrative adaptation of this. By virtue of that I wish they were just playing it straight instead of making the changes they appear to be making by making it "darker" and adding subplots or whatever. I'll still go see it because I'm a big fan of this ballet from always going as a kid and Misty Copeland is one of the hottest women on the planet, so gotta go see her. 
Just missing the words “Tim Burton’s” under the Disney logo. Very strong Timmy vibes. 

Was expecting a cameo from “Off with his head!!!”.  Love that character.
I'm excited but the sets look kind of cheap. 
Is there anything that doesnt sound better with morgan freeman in it?
Is that supposed to be the Rat King at 1:15? 
wtf this looks like it has nothing to do with the Nutcracker at all. I dont even think they showed a nutcracker 
Whhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Wait a sec, did they make the Nutcracker black? Or is that just some random soldier?
Weird. I do not really know what to think. But, Disney is pretty good at making fun movies so I will likely go see it. This does look more like Malificent than Cinderella, which is nice and means it will have some original story.

Also, I don't really know the story of the nutcracker, just the music. So there is no dark side confusion in my mind.
A disney original movie? Well, that's a new

edit: not original = Disney is trash once again
Sweet, yet another version of the Nutcracker for me to watch.  Love the original story, but usually love the other variations too (ballet or not).  I think at this point, I got like 15 different versions in my video library now.   Given the cast, this will be yet another one I'll be watching.
Is this why Solo wasn't pushed to December?
I had no idea this was being made, havn't heard a thing about it.
I mean the production design looks fine but whats with making stuff like Snow White and the Nutcracker into some LotR wannabe?
They're reshooting a shit ton of this
Murphhhhhhhh... and the Four dimensions - Teaser Trailer
Looks like Tim Burton is directing under a different name.
looks like a good time even if just for the visuals, but theres no way they can screw up an already good source material so it should be good
TIL Disney is making a Nutcracker movie

also, getting Alice in Wonderland vibes minus Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter
So.. What is the name of the music in background? I heard it somewhere but i can't remember.
I'm sure people will enjoy this, kids especially, and maybe I will too. But this trailer didn't really do much for me. Might be because I'm not that familiar with the source material itself though.
In what universe is this as popular as beauty and the beast, jungle book or the other Renaissance stuff currently being done in live action? 
This looks bland for me since the style is too familiar with other movies
Do we really need to be told what Disney is and what they brought us? Was the Nutcracker not dark originally? Which of the four realm is Narnia and Wonderland? I'm sure Oz will be the next and they can be multiverse franchise! There ya go Disney, I want 10% of the profits. 
Can't wait for Tchaikovsky's EDM remix that will play during the credits.
Let's see what will happen.. this will go head-to-head with X-Men Dark Phoenix, one week before The Grinch and two weeks before Fantastic Beasts 2... it makes the December Aquaman vs Bumblebee showdown far less crowded by comparison. I hope it's Fantastic Beasts that comes out most victorious but hopefully none of them flops.
So they literally said “Reboot Alice in Wonderland and make it the Nutcracker”

Im so done with this shit man
By the time this comes out, Mackenzie Foy will be 18, but she was 16 when she filmed this. So that will be awkward.
This looks really interesting. A new take on the Nutcracker with Alice/Cinderella style visuals and a fantastic cast. Quite looking forward to this now.
great.. the nutcracker.. yay...
Disney is making a biopic about my ex?
Who is asking for this?!?
Meh :/
Was that Leslie Odom, Jr?
[deleted]
I smell a flop.
There's something really cool about when Keira is gliding down the stairs alongside the soldiers to that music.
JFC this looks exactly like beauty and the beast/cinderella/narnia/tim burton's alice. All these CGI fantasy movies are starting to blur together into the same mediocre blob.
Hard pass.
I'm on board for this because I'm a sucker for anything Nutcracker related. The fact that Keira Knightley is in this just makes it that much sweeter for me.

However... is it really necessary to advertise things like "DISNEY... THE STUDIO THAT BROUGHT YOU... BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" etc. Like... we get it. Disney makes *everything*. With their name plastered all over it, it's kinda hard to miss what studio made the damn movie.
I've literally never heard the legend of the nutcracker.
[deleted]
I totally got Alice in wonderland feels, mixed with some Narnia locations.
It's not too late! He could be the voice of a sugar plum fairy!
Wait, is the beast in this one too? 
It's time to nut...
MUUURPHHHHHHH
in Narnia!
THANK YOU! That is where I knew her from. Kept running in circles not being able to recall.
Ohhh, that's why she looked familiar. Nah, black hair doesn't suit her
"I came here to do two things; chew gum and crack nuts... and I'm all out of gum."
Disney ran out of princesses to adapt, so they're making a new play with explosions and live action. 
From the studio that brought you Beauty and the Beast...

...no, not that one...

...and The Jungle Book...

...no, not that one...

...comes The Nutcracker: I guess it’s a fantasy series now.

Tune in next year for 2Nut 2Cracker.
Rat King Did Nothing Wrong
except looks like rat king is a fucking person in the movie rofl.
I was an extra on this, one of the "ice" creatures you see from minute 1:01 to 1:06. We shot those scenes last year. The rooms you see inside the castle were all sets built in real life. The costumes, hair, make-up... everything was super detailed and took hours to get into each day.

Honestly, I'm really stoked for how this one turns out. The trailer looks great. It looks just as visually stunning as, say, Alice in Wonderland, but instead of a giant CGI fest, most of the stuff you see on screen is real. And it shows. Shot on film, great director, great cinematographer. This will be good.
I'm cautiously optimistic. It LOOKS incredible. The live action remakes of Cinderella and The Jungle Book were excellent. Beauty and The Beast and the others were not good IMHO.
Seriously if all this movie does is have a second-half that isn't endless endless dancing with no plot, they will have succeeded in my eyes
>  Disney has soured me just as much as anyone with all the live action remakes

Taking out of the picture the weird stuff they did with IP/stuff that should be in public domain, it doesn't really bother me. They have this exhaustive list of animated features that quite frankly don't measure up with today's standards. You and I might still love watching them, but I feel like a lot of that is based in nostalgia. The classics like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King are stuff classics, but they're made with sensibilities and production standards of a different era and stuff in them (between everything from the animation, to story beats to acting) might not necessarily measure up.

Cash grabs aside, look at it this way: They're updating all this stuff for a newer, younger audience that's used to CG. I kind of don't really have a problem with that.
But Reddit told me that Disney doesn't produce original content and is a danger to movie making because they make highly profitable comic book movies and Star Wars.
The film is actually going through extensive reshoots without the original director at the moment so we'll see how that goes.
>  Disney has soured me just as much as anyone with all the live action remakes

I dunno, I quite enjoyed Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast and straight up LOVED Jungle Book
creating a new story out of an old fairytale is pretty much Disney's bread and butter. Interesting that it's not animated 
[removed]
You best be careful. Disney will buy you out an extra every one you know. Then you'll just disappear. 
Also, Murph from Interstellar.
Mackenzie Foy has quietly become a reliably great young actor. She gave a pretty heartbreaking performance as the girl in The Little Prince Netflix movie.
Well she is familiar because she is Murph. Who even remembers Twilight ?
I was an extra on this movie, so I can provide some input.

There's one ballet scene (which you see a tiny bit of in the trailer), and it was done by professional ballet dancers: Misty Copeland and Sergei Polunin. That's the only ballet scene you'll see in the movie. None of the main stars will be doing ballet. 

So the film is mostly focused on telling a story, it'll play more like a Narnia fantasy movie, rather than a musical like Beauty & the Beast. There's just going to be that one ballet scene to pay homage to the music & opera,  but that's it.
couldn't they just leave the dancing out of it completely ? Ballet isn't exactly hip amongst the target audience 
She's starting to straight up look like Julianne Moore in the trailer. 
Mahogany Nutcracker confirmed
For a moment I thought that was the sister from Fantastic Beasts.
yeah, every disney classic has a "darkside you didn't know" nowadays with Tim Burton style CGI.
I feel the same. I love The Nutcracker but these"Aliced" movies are getting old. Oz was like this, Maleficent too, even Wrinkle In Time which I'm super stoked about looks like this weird pastry shop polished CGI with Tim Burton undertones. It makes it hard to tell them apart in our minds.
Everything looks like it's on a set, or a stage, with these types of Disney movies (Beauty and the Beast remake had the same look), although in this case it could work in it's favor considering it's source material. 
glad someone else noticed this, made me wonder if it was intentional
>  Disney will try and milk for decades to come.

Dude you don't have to milk a Christmas movie universe. This thing will be shown for decades...
Don't worry, they're not trying to start a Nutcracker universe. This film is based on a script that was long in development. Of course there might be plans for sequel if the movie does well, but at this point, I think it's just a one-off.

From my own experience (I worked as an extra on this movie), all the world-building and characters in this movie served the storyline, and not some arbitrary universe-building.

Also, it's worth noting that there have been several Nutcracker movies in the past, that have ALL failed spectacularly (like, there's no a single one that would justify making this movie) so Disney took a pretty big risk by trying another version of it, and they've taken a lot of steps to make sure there's a good story, good director, etc. to mitigate any chance of failure.
A lot of people don't realize that the original Nutcracker novel by Hoffmann has a long plot with a princess, Drosselmeier's nephew, Clara (Marie in the book) and a lot of spells and curses that were completely cut from the ballet.  Tchaikovski and a lot of the original audiences for The Nutcracker ballet hated it because most of the plot was cut.  I just checked and it looks like this movie is based on the novel, not the ballet.
They had me at Nut.
Didn't know they were shooting in 65mm. They usually never do that unless it's an auteur at the helm. Great move from Disney.
Morgan Freeman is playing the magician Herr Drosselmeyer, he always is dressed strange.  Eyepatch, cloak of mystery, mostly black.  Here he is at the NYC ballet:  http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/robert-lafosse.jpg?itok=EV0wJ6xJ
The rat king is supposed to be a giant demon rat with 7 heads. I hope they keep that, scare the shit out of the kids.
I think you can see the "alive" version of the Nutcracker at 1:03 - 1:04.

To be fair, it's not really an adaptation of the opera, they're taking elements from both the book and the opera, but ultimately it's their take on the story.

One thing to note is that most of the previous film adaptations of the Nutcracker all bombed at the box office, so Disney took a lot of care to make sure the story was good enough for this movie, and also made sure it had a good cast, good director, good cinematographer. Give it a chance. :)
Because $$.
I thought that was Herr Drosselmeyer. 
Because muh diversity or else a film will get no love /s
"Story"

It's basically Alice in Wonderland on drugs
> Also, I don't really know the story of the nutcracker, just the music. So there is no dark side confusion in my mind.

The iconic "bell" part of the Nutcracker Suite is one of the creepiest songs I've ever heard. :)
Original? The Nutcracker is a book written by Ernst Hoffmann in 1816.
Half credit at most, it's not exactly an original property. 
right, because Coco, Moana, Zootopia and Inside Out weren't original.
No, Mary Poppins is.
It's been pretty under the radar. There were some photos from set released last month, but this is the first trailer. Looks pretty great.
Yeah, something like 30 days of reshoots? Strange. The trailer looks great.
Dance of the Sugarplum Fairies
It's a piece from the Nutcracker Ballet.
Who is asking for any movie ?
You’ve never heard of The Nutcracker?
I’m sure they make trailers that cater purely to you and force you to watch it.
But you've heard the music, which is why it's famous.
For a split second I thought Keira Knightley *was* Helena Bonham Carter when she popped up.
or the nutcracker
MAKE HIM STAY!
Nuts and Gum, together at last.
There's only one [Rat King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7ze0Yw9xVU)
This makes me happy, practical sets and effects are the way to go.
Awesome! I could tell pretty quickly that it had a nice look to it that you don't always see, so it being shot on film makes sense.
A Nutcracker movie as good as Branaghs Cinderella would be great. Don't know that that's the vibe they're going for here, though. 
I mean, what else have they remade? Just Alice in Wonderland, right? 
There's just one ballet scene in this movie, and it's done by professional ballet dancers. The rest is story.
I don't know, all the kids I know have no problem enjoying 2D animation. Just look at how TV animation has evolved. Its all flash based, keyframed animation, and kids eat that up. Hardly set to higher production standards than before.

You say its nostalgia that skews our judgement, but most Disney films have aged spectacularly well. Kids don't care. Nostalgia from adults is driving these remakes more than just updating them for a younger generation.
What ? It's CGI animation that doesn't measure up to 2D animation, not the other way around.
Technically its not original content as its based on a famous ballet/story. 
It also looks exactly like the recent Alice and Wonderland 
you're*
Jessica Chastain is pretty famous in her own right
Lots of people. Sure they're shit movies, but what's the point in denying their insane popularity?
I knew I saw Misty in the trailer! The both of them are fantastic, so psyched about this movie. 
I thought they forgot to credit her for a second.
Disney style CGI more likely. When he was at his best, Tim Burton would always choose practical over CGI where he could. He is a practical artist at heart so it's most likely a studio style direction more than anything. Live action Disney movies are starting to bleed together.
It's too bad for him, but I'd say the production design looks better here than in his Wonderland movies.
I mean, to be fair every Disney movie was just a light hearted version of an original... soooooo
Most fairytales were originally dark lol. And this isn't even a Disney classic. 
It was, yeah.  The video description confirms it.

EDIT: Unless JmaesterN meant the second black guy in the trailer, in which case, yeah, that might've been the Nutcracker.
Yeah how dare a-list actor Morgan Freeman want a role in a fairytale from the early 1800s. The fact that he's black is TOTALLY going to make a movie about magical dolls and 7 headed rats look unrealistic, lol
As if to imply Alice in Wonderland isn't already on drugs.
My bad
goddammit jin yang
Yes, 4 originals in .. 3 years? Among 20 sequels/reboots. Sounds right
Did I miss the part where we weren't allowed to have an open discussion about the trailer posted? Pretty sure I said I was into the content, their studio advertising is just over the top. But hey, you read what you want to. 👍
DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE LIKE THIS, MURPH!
WTF are you talking about? Charlie Kelly is the one true [KING OF THE RATS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIWss-_5HGM) 
oh the memories
Definitely. I think a lot of people assume that everything is CGI now, so all the real work and props and set building that went into a scene is unappreciated.

For example, I can confirm everything in [these shots](https://imgur.com/a/Ty6ZS) is real, even though some people would assume it's a green screen in the background.
Two Alice and Wonderlands and Maleficent. All three of which were soulless eye candy. They weren’t straight remakes, just live action riffs in established universes, much like this nut cracker thing seems to be. 
True, but it is original in the sense that they're not re-making one of their animated films (e.g. Beauty & the Beast, Alice in Wonderland, The Lion King) and actually have to come up with a brand new script, production design, costumes, etc. (even if it is based on a book/opera).
While that's true most movies are derived from a book/short story/play/etc. that's kind of my point. People keep trumpeting how this hurts original content but there isn't much original content coming out anyway. Hell most of the high grossing films each year are franchises and sequels.
Shit, I have never even heard of this story before now and hoped it was something original. Only thing familiar to me was the music.
I thought it was Bryce Dallas howard
They were popular back then. I don't think many people are still into them now, because the teenagers have grown up and the craze doesn't seem to have transfered to the new generation.
They were great. We got to see them performing take after take. If you look at [this shot](https://i.imgur.com/kfydOfX.jpg) in the trailer, that's us watching them perform.
Disney is a formula, and Tim Burton can't be held completely at fault. Disney is best known for smothering creativity just for the bigger picture and bottom dollar. I think Disney/Burton is the worst combination to happen since Burton is one of the most stylistic directors. I can't think of anything other than money being the reason for this team up. 
Then imagine how crazy this is.
You don't know what the Nutcracker is?
I think its pretty impressive that Disney is able to consistently release new material every year that are always excellent movies, as well as the re-boots that they do a good job of. What more do you want?
Three years? We can also count:

You can also count Tomorrowland, The Good Dinosaur, The Finest Hours, and Queen of Katwe for new material. 
Alright
That does kind of take the piss out of the people who insist cg doesn't look real tho. If you can mistake reality for cgi, then cgi must be pretty good. 

Huh. For some reason, all this time I was under the impression that Maleficent wasn't Disney. *Shrug*. What about Pete's Dragon, what'd you think of that? 
Fantasia includes music from the ballet, does that count?
No it was actually Christina Hendricks
You are probably wrong. Almost every month, freeform (formerly ABC Family) has a twilight weekend (like Harry Potter weekend). Clearly, the movies are still popular enough to have semi-regular showings. 
Thanks for all the details on this movie! How long did your makeup take as an extra? Are you part of the dance scenes? 

I am so excited about it, the shot of Clara opening the door was so lovely, I was sold. 
[deleted]
>The Nutcracker is a book written by Ernst Hoffmann in 1816.
They just need a few indie academy award wins. They already win animation 90% of the time. They're getting pretty good with vfx and make up now. Just need to get those acting and direction nominations animation wins to conquer hollywood.
Not one of those was successful, so I hadn't even heard of them. My bad
Alright
Exactly. Also above comment implied CGI props and sets are not "real work", but I'm used to it at this point.
Oh yeah. Forgot about Pete’s Dragon. I was uninterested as I barely remember the original, but I ended up watching it (the new live action version) one afternoon on Netflix with the kiddos. Was shocked how good it was. It was a regular at the house for several weeks.
I mean... the music is its own thing. It can stand on its own two feet, and inspire films / be used in films.

Is this particular movie inspired by the music? Sure. But it still has to have its own story, its own dialogue, its own action sequences. By that metric, it's an original film. (to me)
Uh.. I'd say there's a couple reasons it's easy to tell when someone is or isn't Christina Hendricks. 
Before we started shooting, we first had a fitting, so that they could tailor the costume to us, figure out which wig we'd be wearing, how the make-up would look.

I was part of the "Ice Realm", so they had the make-up artists basically experiment on our faces for a day, to see if they needed to add more bluish tints, more glitter, more glue (to make icicles on our faces), etc. Same thing for the extras that were in the Flower Realm and the Candy Realm, they would see which look they liked best for them.

Then, after they settled on a cohesive look for each of the realms, and the head of the make-up department was happy, they took photos of us, labeled all the costumes & wig with our number, and sent us home.

Then we came back for the actual shoot. I'd wake up at around 5am, get to set at 6am, grab some breakfast. We'd put on the costumes, then go to make-up chair. Usually there was about 60 to 100 extras a day, and about 20 to 30 make-up people working on us. The make-up and wig would take about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how much of a wait there was. In between takes, they'd also come and fix us up, spray more glitter on our face, etc.

[Here's a photo](https://i.imgur.com/1Ya9Vla.jpg) of us in full make-up and costume, waiting in the 'extras tent' until the next scene.

None of us were part of the dance scenes, we were just the background characters who live in the castle :) There's just one big ballet scene, to pay homage to the music and opera, and it's done by professional ballet dancers (Misty Copeland and Sergei Polunin). It was really well-done.
Speaking of his Disney relationship in general. 
Alright
Yeah i mean its not "*just* cgi," because just like practical effects there's a hundred different departments and techniques in every shot. Different people doing texturing, modeling, animation, cloth simulation, fire simulation, texture simulation, lighting, design, compositing, motion tracking, camera tracking...
Wow, that sounds like so much fun as an extra! Thanks for all the details and your obvious enthusiasm for the project. I will think of you when I watch it next year :) 
DUN LEMME LEEEV MEEERF!!!
Aww, thanks for the gold! It *was* really fun. Even the make-up artists said this was a pretty special movie, since they could experiment and use their creativity so much more than on a typical blockbuster.

The hardest part was waiting more than a year to finally see a trailer! :)
