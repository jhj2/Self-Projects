It seems like another "When the Bough Breaks" or "Obsessed", which kind of turned me off because Taraji (and Tyler Perry at this point) are way better than rehashing that type of movie. 

Also when he reveals the fiancee, it reminded me of Perry's first big movie "Diary of a Mad Black Woman" (guy has been with girl for x amount of years, suddenly moves on to new girl).

I'm hoping there's more to it, maybe some kind of psychological or disillusioned angle since she is talking to a psychiatrist, because I love Taraji and I like the vibe that the trailer set. 
Tyler Perry hasn’t made a decent flick since the family that preys.. 

Hopefully this doesn’t end up being completely cliché
