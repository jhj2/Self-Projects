Brb getting into screenwriting 
I get a feeling like there is gonna be a lot of Eddie Brock in this movie and a small amount of Venom
What's going to be on Venom's chest if the symbiote was never worn by Parker?
"EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO"

Really? Kind of on the nose, no?... 

And of course super predictable that they're framing him as your typical likable anti-hero. I was really hoping they would go for a more villainous take. 

But then again, I suppose that's what Carnage is for!
She is literally the WOOO-O-O-O-ORSSTTT at hiding in plain sight 


John Ralphio's sister? "Give me Symbiote, please". 
I'm gonna guess that the actual full Venom will be onscreen for less of 15 minutes.
[deleted]
> The Guy you work for is an Evil Person.

Does Avi Arad have a cameo?
Sorry Sony but "EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO" is not as epic sounding as you think it is. 
Well the dialogue is... oof. 
Why are so many movie villains obsessed with finding 'the next step in human evolution'? It's becoming this strange trope. 
This is the music from the second Infinity War trailer, is it not?
Lmao did they use the same song from Avengers Infinity War Trailer 2 for this one?

Edit: yeah Redshift from Audiomachine
https://youtu.be/c4G2sWk5jvM
Reminds me of that Prototype video game.
Like:
1 The voice of Venom

2 SONY remembered that Venom refers to itself as We 

Dislike:
1 The way the mouth moves when Venom speaks, it looks off

2 The pronunciation of Symbiote

3 "The Guy you work for is an evil person"
I like Tom Hardy, but that accent
If this Venom never met spider man, then why does it look like spiderman?
This feels like the hottest movie of the 1997 Christmas Season. 
This looks like one of those shitty early 00's Marvel movies. 

Like Daredevil, Hulk and Ghost Rider.
On one hand, I really want this movie to be good since the Venom design is sick.

On the other hand, I don't want Sony to keep making Spider-Man spin-off movies that have no connection to Spider-Man in them. 
"The guy you work for is the evil person" 

Oh my god... this is gonna suck isn't it.

The "We Are Venom" was pretty Bad-ass tho.
"SymBYEote"
Predicting a disaster of a third act when Venom and Carnage fight.
A Venom movie with Carnage and a hard R rating could and would be incredible. I’m so disappointed they’re not going to take notes from Deadpool and Logan. 
I seriously didn’t realize Jenny Slate was in this and now I can’t unsee her Parks and Recreation character.
this looks like a B movie.
Just not feeling it. Hope it proves me wrong when it comes out, but if it doesn't, this film better teach Sony their lesson. And hopefully we'll get ALL of the Spiderverse in the MCU.
Why is Tom Hardy giving me strong Forest Gump / Simple Jack vibes at times?
Looks like Sony is getting ready to sell the rights for Spider-Man to Disney...
>In association with Marvel

There's going to be people who will be mistaken into thinking this is part of the MCU.
You can't make a Venom origin movie without Spider-Man. You just *can't*. Venom's origin *is* Spider-Man.


It's like a Bizarro movie without Superman. Or a Mecha-Godzilla movie without Godzilla. It's just *wrong.*
Super cringey dialogue from what I heard. Yeesh. Except for 'We are Venom!', that was cool. 
So... I'm not getting a good feeling from this writing. I'm not sure if it's the delivery, or how ham-fisted it is but some of these lines *really* felt off. Brock practically turns to the camera and says "The love interest works for the villain."

Not 100% on the direction they're taking with the action either. I just saw the trailer for [Upgrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36PDeN9NRZ0) and its done the same way: Action hero is super good at beating up bad guys but pretty much has everything done for him. I mean it's not that big a deal because that kinda happens in the source material, so whatever.

Look I get it, he looks bigger than Topher Grace. He looks more accurate to the comics than Spidey 3. Everyone wants to see Venom on screen, myself included. But I'm still not convinced.

I don't want to be the person that goes to watch a movie already soured, and I think that's the worst possible way to watch a movie. I'm just saying that if I were a gambling man, I wouldn't bet on this.

Edit: Oh yeah, as for the weird pronunciation of *symbiote*.... I was thrown off for a bit but I guess they're going with [symbiont](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/symbiont) instead. So while not technically wrong... such a weird decision when there's a lot of source material with an agreed-upon pronunciation. The conspiracy theorist in me says this was mandated by Marvel Studios in case they ever want to introduce the sybiotes separately.
Looks like another generic and forgettable story with a character that looks cool. 
This feels more like a movie of the game Prototype than a movie about Venom.
This movie looks EXACTLY how you would not want this movie to look.
[deleted]
I'm... Still not sold.
Released on the day of the premiere of infinity war. Hmm
Wowee, babyyy I am no longer excited for this!!
Why did they pick Jenny Slate for this movie lol
It reminds me more about the game "The Darkness"
You know Sony is in a bad place when people breathe a sigh of relief from seeing the Venom character in a Venom trailer. 
"I'm hearing a voice."

*EDDEEEEEE*
I love Jenny Slate, but she doesn’t fit this kind of film, especially if she’s gonna mis-pronounce Symbiote like that. 
That looks... Not great. That motorcycle jump is laughable. 

Maybe I'm not as knowledgeable as other comic book fans, but it seems weird to introduce Venom as an antihero. 
Venom sounds like Mr. Claw from Inspector Gadget

https://youtu.be/V1j7lyRnxVE
Whoever came up with "Embrace your inner anti-hero" should never be allowed to be involved in film again, just terrible.

SIM-BUY-OAT!

Still excited cuz not Topher Grace, but who the hell can't pronounce symbiote correctly?
This is definitely a movie!
I can't over the symbiotic appendages coming out of Tom Hardy's stomach. It looks comical. The movie doesn't seem as dark as the teaser portrayed it.
Yiiikes.... the arms and motorcycle stuff.... 

The full suit looks great tho so it’s got that going for it.

Edit: /s
"the guy you work for is an evil person"
A Venom movie! and by Venom I guess they mean just Tom Hardy shooting black columns of cgi jelly out of his hoodie and then about 5 minute of total on screen actual Venom. Also very skeptical that Carnage does not appear at all in this trailer. Something tells me he'll only appear in the very final scene and the rest of the time will just be Tom Hardy punching generic gun men.
Let's make it plain and clear and simple: Marvel are succeeding because, ever since Iron Man, they've been making character-piece movies about characters with powers. Movies that happen to have a lot of cool action set-pieces, yes, but that revolve around character development.

Every trailer showcases that character development, not the powers.

Sony, the questions your trailer should be answering are things like "Who is Eddie Brock?" and "Why should we care?". 

That you don't/can't answer these questions is what tells me this is an action puff-piece with no substance, the content of which will be dissavowed by Marvel, robbing us of a great Spiderverse character.
omg Sony just stop...
There should be a Venom movie-based breakfast cereal called Symbi-Oats.
It's been 4 hours... why isn't a new SONY film greenlit, what's taking so long? 
Ok understandable have a good day sir
Hollywood screenwriting isnt all about dialogue. Its about taking notes from producers idiotic ideas and their friends idiotic ideas and stuffing them into the movie somewhere without the movie falling apart.

Cue giant mechanical spider. 
Remember, your screenwriting has to match the budget and CGI is expensive as hell. The producer is gonna gut your script to add more filler dialog so the industry can make a profit.
Doesn’t take much apparently
It's going to be a lot of Tom Hardy playing a guy named Eddie Brock with a small amount of Venom. 
I'm thinking some of the other people in the thread are right. It's probably one of the last few scenes of the film. 
Yeah I suspect you saw 80% of Venoms screen time in that trailer. 
I'm also curious as to what exactly Venom's powers are going to be and why. I mean, Venom's powers are *meant* to be a mimicry of Spider-Man's that the symbiote "remembers" from its time on Peter. That's like a key point of Venom. Will he still have Spider-Man style powers in this movie? If he does, why?
*Damaged*
It'll probably be nothing. In the Ultimate line, there was no symbol on the suit initially (and later? I forget). The only white on the suit was the eyes.
[deleted]
It means hope.


[deleted]
That’s something Deadpool would ironically say
Cue the villain getting Carnage-like powers then fighting Venom at the climax... if this doesn't happen I'll be seriously surprised.
Carnage will unfortunately be fucked up by Sony whenever it's his time. They won't be willing to make him as a psychotic and evil as he needs to be, and we'll get this edgelord character that acts "OMG so random lol". 
Money pleasssseeeeeeeeeee
Simba-ote
https://youtu.be/pKZFMjknquM
When life gives you a venom symbiote, you sell your grandmother’s jewellery and go clubbing!
"Give me SymBYEote, please"
FTFY
PWEEASSSEEE*
“She’s the wooooorrrrrssssssttttt”
Remember Sony spoiling the Rhino fight for ASM 2 in the trailer and it was the last shot of the film? 

I bet it’s the same here. 
Not even. That "We are Venom" scene will be the climax of the movie, probably 10 minutes from the end, and it will be the only scene with full Venom.
I’m sensing this’ll be like the Ghost Rider movies. The stuff with the full Venom suit will be the most unbelievably badass shit ever, but the rest of the movie will be mediocre (or just painful to sit through if this trailer’s dialogue is any indicator). Great for 4 minute clips on YouTube, basically. 
I'd be ok with that as long as they make Eddie Brock interesting. From this trailer, I like Hardy's acting but hope the writing is up to par. Though the dialogue, from what we heard thus far, is sub par throughout.
Yeah looks like they are doing that stupid shit like in xmen where mystique is just j law for most of her appearance. I get they can save money on fx that way but...fuck man you are doing a movie about an alien humanoid monster here that's big and hulking...
"The guy you work for is an evil person!"
Venom sounds pretty fucking cheesy too. Who wrote this...

Kelly Marcel, Fifty Shades of Grey.

Oh... god.


If you're going to stay here, you're only going to hurt BAD people.
Hahahahaha but for real- fuckkkk Avi Arad.
Demons, as cheesy as it is, sounds much better than 'Anti-Hero'.

Oof.
just like that, sony fell into one of the most simple traps in movie making - assuming your audience is retarded.

we dont need you to explicitly tell us venom is an anti hero, or a hero, or a villain, or a brainless beast. we can decide on our own. there's no need to bash us in the head with it.
"I'm a reporter. I hear you're trying to kill people. So what gives?"

10/10 give them the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay already goddammit 
I cringed when they flashed “Anti-Hero” on the screen. Feels a little diminishing 
Ok good it's not just me. 
"The man you work for is an evil person"

"If you're going to stay you're only going to hurt bad guys"

I have a feeling this will be an oof that will be heard around the globe when it releases...
>It's becoming this strange trope

More like it's BEEN a trope, especially with superhero fare
People keep finding steps man. And the more steps you find, what do you get? ... Stairs dude..  stairs
Welcome to the plot of 99% of the ultimate marvel comics. Everything is tied to captain americas super soldier serum or tony starks super soldier armor or hulks super soldier transforming radiation, or the mutant gene that could develope super soldiers or green goblins failed super soldier serum, or Spider-Man’s fluke of a success super soldier serum, or........
I noticed that! Thought I was going crazy. 
Came here to say that. Was wondering if it was meant to imply something but I doubt.
Exactly. It's [Audiomachine - Redshift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFuYyHiOmXs).
Sony is like Joey in that episode of Friends where he finds a Porsche parked on the street and starts hanging out nearby it so people will think its his, only the Porsche is the MCU and it's somehow even more pathetic.
VENOM IN THE MCU CONFIRMED! ^/s
lmao i knew it... jesus christ sony you aren't making this easy on yourselves.
SONY 6D chess to promote their new Spider-man video game on the PS4
> Reminds me of that Prototype video game.

Exactly what I was thinking.
To be fair, Venom's mouth doesn't make anatomical sense, so I'll give them some leeway on lip-syncing weirdness.  Still agree completely though.
Everytime he uses an "American accent", he sounds a little slow. He tends to slur and sound constipated. 
He sounds like he took a similar New York accent course that Gosling took for his accents.

The Marlon Brando institute of New York accents.
I mean, it's not the worst New York accent I've ever heard, but it's far from good.

If the movies good though, I'll probably forget about it really quickly.
It's Sony...

They kinda just do stuff without reason.
Cue the montage scene where Venom tries to find his look and sees Spider-Man on the news.
haha this does look like spawn
Reminds me more of catwoman. Beloved villain/anti-hero removed from all context of the original comics while an unrelated movie is forced around them.
Don't forget Elektra
Pretty much my same mentality. Love Tom Hardy, so I'm there for him regardless. But if it isn't set in the MCU with Holland's Spider-Man, that would be beyond idiotic
From what I can tell, Sony is going to say it’s MCU canon and Marvel is going to say it’s not. 
It's from the writers of 50 Shades Of Grey & Gangster Squad...

:/
Why is dialogue so easy to not fuck up where they end up fucking it up.  

"Allegations that say you recruit the most vulnerable people for tests that *end up killing people*."

That is so weak and easily re-written. No journalist beyond a high school newspaper would ever waste a one-shot opportunity for a pointed question like that. Ughhhhh.
[deleted]
I know, right? I grew up on Spider-Man video games pronouncing it as "SymBEEyote"
They seriously couldn't get someone on set to correct her in its pronunciation? Ugh...
They said it like 18 times too lol.
Po-TAE-to Po-TYE-to
Who's ready for a slimey cgi clusterfuck?
They’ve already announced Woody Harrelson as Carnage, but it is pretty much confirmed that will be a post-credits scene since they wrapped filming two months before that announcement. Riz Ahmed is the villain.
I want a solo Carnage movie with a hard R, but I want it to be a horror movie. In the cartoon from the 90's, Carnage scared the shit out of me. Still does.
In before they make that company president Carnage instead of Cletus Kasady
Literally the wo^oo^^^ooo ^^oo ^o oorst! 
Definitely don't search YouTube for "Marcel the Shell".
It looks like a fake trailer in a real movie.
Don't hold your breath. This is Sony we are talking about. It IS going to suck.

This trailer gives off the pre 2008 vibes. 
I know right? Spiderverse is such a cool concept to have its own movies; Carnage, Venom, Spidey vs. Venom, Spiderverse itself. Venom is a crucial part of Peter's story, it really deserves some attention. Too bad the suits won't let simple folk enjoy the movies because of all these rights mambo-jumbo.  
"You're *only* gonna hurt people who do *bad* things."
Because when Tom Hardy does an American accent, he goes with mentally disabled.
"Everybody knows you never go full spinoff."

"What do you mean?"

"Check it out. Sony, 2007, *Spiderman 3*. Shitty villains, shitty third act, not a spinoff. Studio meddling, emo dancing. Disappointing sequel, sho'. Not a spinoff. You know Columbia Pictures, 2011, *Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance*. Sequel, yes. Minor franchise, maybe. Nicholas Cage starring. But he co-starred with Idris Elba and piloted a [flaming bagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDzQddhYmJs). That ain't spinoff material. It was a badass battle scene. You know any spinoffs with flaming baggers? You went full spinoff, man. Never go full spinoff. You don't buy that? Ask Fox, 2009, *X-Men: Origins: Wolverine*. Remember? Went full spinoff, went home empty-handed."
At least he didn't go full retard.
Sony: Ha! Try to revive this character like what you did with spider-man
Just hypothetically speaking, how much would that cost? 500 million? 
Spider-Man VII: The Force Awakens
thats probably sony's plan
Or a Joker movie with no Batman, which WB is already planning.
the guy you work for is an evil person
And that line is lifted directly from various Spider-Man stories so can’t commend the writers for that one.
I saw the trailer for Upgrade as a youtube commercial and totally thought it was the Venom trailor because that guy even looks like tom hardy.
Try 2006 
It was leaked when they showed it at cinemacon and it was gonna be attached to IW anyway.
Using the same music as the second Infinity War trailer too
Alia Shawkat was booked?
She was the WOOO-OOO-oooo-OOORST choice for a serious role. 
That would be such a better idea too. The Darkness is awesome! And, coincidentally, the main character isn't dependent on Spiderman!
This looked more like a Darkness rip-off than Venom.
That was the first thing that came to my head when I saw the tendrils take control. Even the voice talking to him reminded me of that game.
I’m waiting for the edit now of “I’m hearing a voice.”

“ED EDD N EDDY”

*high pitched whistling*
I can’t help but think the pronunciation is an intentional choice (albeit not the right one) by Ruben Fleischer, otherwise I’m sure someone would have corrected her. Just like the pronunciation of “Aang” in *The Last Airbender.* So I don’t think I blame Jenny Slate for it.
“Symbiote? More like uh-Sym-uh-BYEEEEE-ote okayeeeee”
Venom is an antihero in the comics, he is a villain to spidey but its because he hates him for personal reasons, not because he is a bad guy
Venom is a hero, Carnage is a villain. Spider-Man and Venom have the same relationship Daredevil and Punisher have 
Seriously, what’s with the motorcycles? It feels like I’m watching a really campy, early 2000s action flick— which is not a good thing.
Just as shitty as “So that’s it huh? We’re some kind of Suicide Squad?”
Idk they may just not wanna blow their load on Carnage in the first trailer

I'm trying to be optimistic
Seriously, Netflix has produced 6 comedy specials, 3 indie sci-fi films, and 22 seasons of digitally rendered anime in that time.
Trying to get Adam Sandler in another rocom with Drew berrymore and Kevin James as a support character... 
“You want me to write a scene where Brainiac is razzlin' polar bears?”
Bright proved that

Somehow sold for 3 million

Brb getting into screenwriting
Tom Hardy is almost good enough to make that worthwhile on his own.

Almost.
He's a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude 
> Tom Hardy playing a guy named Eddie Brock

It's going to be Tom Hardy playing a dude pretending to be a Symbiote dude.
Looks like his powers are pretty much what they usually are. He has super strength, toughness, and agility just by the symbiote itself. Even the creature on it's own looks much larger than the comics. Instead of wrist-webs he projects full extensions of the symbiote. Reminds of me of that game, Prototype.

Edit: Apparently the game *The Darkness* is very similar to this too.

Edit 2: And Ultimate Spider-Man, it seems.
I didn't think this iteration of Spider-Man had web slinging as a *power*, isn't it something he wears?


HA hA ha ha Ha hA
Oh god no.
Until this moment I wasn't aware I have suicide squack related PTSD.
You're right! Ultimate Venom did not have anything on his chest. Great comic series by the way.
On his planet it means hope.
Please no
"V" for Vaio to advertise more Sony products?
jesus christ
What's the joke here?
🖕

What does this stand for on your planet, *gratitude*?
This.

The only reason they said that is because "anti-hero" was used in conjunction with Deadpool.

And they want the Deadpool hype to carry over to here.
I think they'll leave it to the next movie. Betting they'll end with Brock in prison meeting Kasady and then the symbiote spawning Carnage. Maybe a post-credits scene later with Carnage but that's it.
Shitt, I knew I had seen her before somewhere!
Oh, my bad, no problem. I'll just destroy this store. MONEY PWEAAASSEEE
Pub\-liz\-ity. It's based on our naaames.
I made my money the old fashioned way: I got run over by a LEXUUUUUUS!
If Jean-Ralphio isn't in the movie, I'm walking out
Sim By Oat
Lol yeah, what was with that pronunciation. 
"Uuuuuuuuuoooooohh thank you, Vennooooom!!!"
Fuck u right.
I felt so bad for Rhino fans, anyone that went to see the movie for Rhino probably lost their minds
God, what an absolute waste of Paul Giamatti.
They outright had  Rhino on so many posters yet he's only in the final 30 seconds of the movie

Sony....like, what?
Lol X-Men apocalypse ended the same way, with all the X-Men in their costumes in the Danger Room
That made me rage more than I can explain. It’s like clickbait has evolved and taken the form of spoiler ridden movie trailers. 
"We. Are Venom" *guy screams* roll credits
[deleted]
There was more Ghost Rider in *Agents of SHIELD* than in the movies.
rumor has it tom hardy only agreed to star in this movie provided sony funds his next one.

this does not bode well.
I bought Ghost Rider when it came out just to see the giant flaming hell wheel scene on Blu-ray and I don't even regret it. 
> but hope the writing is up to par

It absolutely will not be.
Well, from my point of view the Jedi are evil!
The greatest writing always does away with vivid imagery and colorful prose. 

*How do I describe this person as the villain?*

"The guy you work for is an evil person"

*How do I let the audience know I'm good at hiding, but this girl is not?*

"Hey, you suck at hiding."

*How do I tell the audience that the main character is conflicted - but not exactly a villain*

Spell out that he's an anti-hero right in the trailer. 


Destined to become the new “I don’t like sand.”
please say you're joking......
Why in the fuck would anyone give that person a gig writing screenplays?

Literally her entire body of work is a warning of how bad a writer she is.
I was getting an ice cream cone at Rite Aid, and when the cashier asked me what i wanted, someone fake coughed behind me and said "two scoops". It was Avi Arad. I was really surprised, so i turned to look at him, and he started scooping my man-boobs up and down really fast, staring me dead in the eyes and saying "two scoops" the entire time. I tried to turn back around and ignore him, but every time i opened my mouth to order he'd interrupt with another "two scoops" behind my back, really aggressively like he wanted me to fight him. The cashier and I were in shock, but I finally choked out that I wanted a single scoop butter pecan. Avi Arad just smirked and threw his entire wallet down on the counter. He told the cashier "he wants cake batter. Two scoops", then walked out of the store.

There didn't end up being anything in the wallet.
Thank god he dropped out of the MCU before he had the chance to fuck it up.
Good one. Embrace your demons would be a badass tagline (if no one used it yet) which is why Sony will never use it.
I was expecting it to say "venom".
This is typically what happens when you pitch "EMBRACE YOUR INNER DEMONS" as a tagline.

"But will 18-25 year old males understand Venom isn't a literal hell creature?"  
"We want to make sure audiences know Venom is a type of super hero who's also sort of bad, not a demon."  
"What if if we just go with 'EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO'?"  
"Don't worry guys. He does some bad things, but only to bad people. But he's really good! He'll be good by the end!"
Wasn't it the half in the bag guys that said Sony executives basically have a pipeline of incompetence that just churns out bad movies? 

They have a culture of playing it safe and historically making really stupid decisions that end up ruining otherwise good films. 
Sony's been in this rut since the Amazing Spiderman movies. These movies feel like they're designed by committee. A committee of old farts that are grossly out of touch with what current tastes and expectations are for a movie. This is shit that would be mediocre even in the 00's. But since it's a post Marvel cinematic land scape people expect better. It's why Marvel/Disney had to bail them out with the Spiderman team up.
It's really annoying when trailers introduce characters by having say what their job is. The guy is asking questions and has a camera crew. What else could he be?

Lots of other bad dialogue that feels forced
This is gonna be like Charlie's script for Dennis' political speech.

"You are bad man. I good! So halt or you will regrets have."
As a journalist I can confirm this is 100% authentic-sounding
I was super disappointed at that too. Anti-hero? Really? Isn't that a bit on-the-nose? And reductive. 
Makes sense too.

I don't know any super villains that want to reverse human evolution. That's not very spooky.
You’d think with all these evil scientists running around they’d have taken an evolution course at some point. 
“Big evil governments want to make armies stronger so that they can take over the world”
[deleted]
Lmao this is a fantastic analogy. Have you seen that interview with Amy Pascal and Kevin Feige? It's pretty much also this, with her being Joey and Feige being the Porsche
Careful, you're going to give Feige an aneurysm 
Well, Eddie Brock is supposed to be a little slow and beefy.
It's honestly just how Hardy is. He's rarely in anything where he sounds normal. Love a lot of his acting, but his voice is either muffled, slurred, changed, or just plain odd. 
**Why** is it a New York accent though? The film's emphatically set in San Francisco.
I'm still in disbelief this movie is even happening.

Seriously though, when they flashed the sony logo at the start, I was like wait is that supposed to be a good thing?
Part of the problem is that I can't tell whether or not this is a joke.

Tom Holland is currently listed on imdb for this movie, but given that some sort of plot isn't even listed yet, I'd wager he's just on there as a placeholder.

**OR HE COULD BE IN THE NEWS MONTAGE**
Maybe he'll touch the TV screen and moan "learning". This looks like that kind of movie. 
Catwoman was possibly one of the worst movies I have ever watched. 


Especially that [super-cringy basketball scene...](https://youtu.be/rNlmRId2FVQ)


But I tried so hard to forget it.
"In association with Marvel" makes me think it's not.
Sony are wrong though.
:(
Oh holy shit... Not gonna lie I enjoyed Gangster Squad but wow... What a resume haha
It sounded like that dialogue was made for the trailer by splicing together several lines.
But did you see that quickly cut to reaction?!

He totally nailed him. Clearly nobody had ever asked such a thought-provoking question before. 
To me, that meme has been up for centuries.
Sony has a good track run of fucking up Spider-Man though.
Also the first line Eddie says is "The guy you work for is a evil person."

That's the opening line you give your character? Really?
**Assistant Director**: "Fuck it, close enough. CUT"
They really go in on that pronunciation too haha

It's like the "**bye**" is emphasized. 
Fingers crossed for a blue sky laser
That’s my fetish. 
With the right director, that would truly be a terrifying film
"The Evil Person", rated R
"The *guy* you work for is an *evil person*!"
Feige: Hold my beer

Legit though the aftermath of Infinity War would perfectly stage the Symbiote's arrival on Earth. Peter just needs to find it in some back alley and boom, you've got black-suit spiderman. It can even corrupt Karen and be a better version of the voice from the Venom trailer. Not sure where they would get Eddy Brock from though.
not less than 1 billion, probably more. make it a little more money and Disney gets the whole Sony studio.
[That's literally Sony's plan](http://collider.com/venom-mcu-spider-man-homecoming-amy-pascal/)
Not crashing this plane?
I was going to say that, but at least the Joker didn't base his appearance around Batman.

How can Venom possibly be a completely separate entity from Spider-Man, that just so happens to look exactly like a monstrous black-suit Spider-Man, and also just so happens to have all his powers, too? That is crazy.

Now, if the Joker movie is an origin story, and fucking Batman *isn't there* at Ace Chemicals with him when the time comes, *I will riot.*
I'm getting frustrated with all these studios trying to copy the MCU without putting in the actual work that Marvel did. 

I get it, shared universes are the hot shit right now, but you have to put the time in. 
Dennis is a bastard man
I thought of the Upgrade trailer the entire time I was watching this, and not just because of the similarity between Tom Hardy and Discount Tom Hardy. 

Lots and lots of similarities. Tom Hardy has a girlfriend he's trying to protect. Lite and Easy Tom Hardy has a girlfriend he's trying to avenge. Tom Hardy gets superpowers that come with a scary voice in his head. Store-brand Tom Hardy gets superpowers that come with a friendly voice in his head. Tom Hardy's powers beat people up on his behalf while he goes like 'whoa what's going on'. I Can't Believe It's Not Tom Hardy powers beat up people on his behalf while he goes like 'whoa what's happening right now'

What's a shame is that Upgrade is probably made for 1/10 the cost, will be 10 times better and make 1/100 the money that this Venom movie does. 

Moral of the story: ensure you buy genuine approved Tom Hardy 
Oh man, with one of those horrible bro-friendly soundtracks featuring original music by Nickelback, POD, and many others of the mook-rock genre, the only one making it actually into the film would be a song in the end credits.

He used to be an outright villain in the beginning, but compared to the other symBYEotes(why movie?) has really mellowed out in his later years.
Venom was definitely a villain at first, pure hatred for Spider-Man. As time went on he became more anti-hero. 
If we're going to pull shitty lines from characters that should've been intelligent in suicide squad then you need to go with the following.

Waller : lets just say I put them in the hole and threw away the hole

Or

Random army general : they're bad guys
"Hello, this is Netflix; you're green lit."
And 9 of those star Adam Sandler.
[deleted]
His character in Peaky Blinders (Alfie Solomons) is one of my favorite characters ever. 

His speech in the Season 3 Finale... Goddamn, it was brilliant. 
What do you mean, "you symbiote"
If I remember right he also had those extensions on the maximum Carnage game for snes
The scene with Eddie’s arm turning into black symbiote shit and attacking the goons gave me a huge Prototype vibe.
I feel like prototype is somehow unheard of, underground game, that's literally everyone has played. It's weird.
***IF*** Venom gets a chest symbol it likely won't be until the end. Or if they let Tom Holland shoot the sequel maybe then. But think about it...all of the marketing material so far uses the menacing face design as his calling card over the usual angsty version of the Spider-man symbol. 

I'm 99% convinced were getting a marvel themed prototype game adaption movie. And I'm super down for that. The voice and suit look awesome. He can evolve into Marvel Vemom later on. 
Or the darkness
When Spidey gets the Venom suit, he is able to generate webs without his web shooters.
> suicide squack

It seems that you were also bitten by a radioactive duck.
Ahem, that's *Academy Award-winning* Suicide Squad.
IIRC the movie is based on the Lethal Protector story with elements from the Ultimate line, so with that in mind, I actually like this trailer and I think I'll enjoy the movie.

That being said, I'm sure the general audience won't be on board, critics won't like it, and it'll be a flop. But I'll still be there opening weekend.
Hope is spelled with an H, stupid.
I hear it's just going to be a picture of Tom Hardy. 

It means hope.
V for Vita
It’s Jason Bourne
I think it's like how Superman has an S on his chest, so Venom would have a V... I'm not sure though
That actually means peace among worlds
How did Mona Lisa Saperstein end up in a Marvel movie??
Hey bro can I sleep on your couch because I'm technically HOOOooooOoooomless!

So it wasn’t just me?!
I’ve been saying sim-bee-yote since I was a kid and this was weird to me.
She is the WOOOYOYOYOOORRSST. No seriously she is the worst. 
How much you wanna bet that it's really the last scene of the film? The kicker being that throughout the film Tom Hardy refuses to embrace the symbiote, referring to himself as 'I' the whole time. At the end he finally gives in, and both voices combine to say 'we'.

Edit: Yes, I get it. He does say 'we' in some scenes. I'm not going to defend my statement because I actually want to be wrong and get a decent Venom movie.
Luckily there was probably only about 7 of them because why would you go purely to see a mid-tier henchmen.
Roll credits
this dumb shit never fails to make me lol
All my friends are inky sym-bi-otes...
This is the symbiote. He takes control of the body of those he comes in contact with. I'd advise you not to bond with him. 

-or-

We're the Venom! It's what we do!
Hopefully that means we get a good tom hardy movie after though. I enjoyed Taboo plenty
So you're the guy
The guy you work for is an evil person! 
> EMBRACE YOUR INNER ANTI-HERO 

Yeaaaaah I don't have the best hopes for the writing.
I can already see this being a 6/10 on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes hating it. 
It's treason, them.
about as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face
The sad thing is they’re wasting Tom Hardy with that shit writing...dude is a great actor 
He is not
[deleted]
She wrote the screenplay for the movie *based* on the book "fifty Shades of Grey" by author E.L James. 

Probably not the best writer but she didn't write that terrible book
Avi Arad asked to borrow my lawnmower once and I lent it to him since he promised to return it right away. He never brought it back. Turns out he doesn't live in my neighborhood.
Yeah, I was definitely expecting "Embrace your inner demon" in the singular.

Dunno anything about the movie, but Venom looks perfect. The nuance in the eye animation is stunning. 2 hours of him just running around looking cool will be enough for me \(they had better not just save the full suit for the last act...\)
Same on this. Just as hamfisted but at least more logical. And in a way that works okay. Theyre gonna have to come up with a reason for him to be named such...
He rapes, but he saves, and he saves more than he rapes.

Couch casting guy?'
Thank you. Thaaaaank you.
Why waste time with lot word when few word do trick?
As a farmer I can confirm people do announce their profession in conversation
Yeah it said "embrace your" and my I was like oooo and my mind flashed between "demons" "dark side" etc and then "anti hero" came up and I was like welp there's that too... I.... Suppose?

"The guy you work for is a evil person."

Well they're writing him right then.
Yeah, I don't know. I guess that's just his go-to accent and since Brock has some connections to NYC they just went with that lol.
That’ll be his cameo. Eddie will watch a TV with Spider-Man saving the day (maybe the boat scene from Homecoming?) and the voice in his head will see it and like it and say something poorly written like, “I like what I see.”

You get the idea 
Anyone can edit IMDB though right?
And John Cena was in Thor Ragnarok too! IMDB confirmed it!
I hate how right you are.
I don't even have to click that link, I'm already dying inside.
I mean it's a 100% Sony produced film, unlike Homecoming which was a collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. So it's like the X-Men films that have the basic Marvel logo, but no collaboration with Marvel Studios
From my point of view, MCU is evil 
Yeah, not the resume you'd want for a huge tentpole film like this.
Lots of awkward hard-cuts, for sure. 
Son**EYE**
At least they're consistent

This was written by Kelly Marcel (Fifty Shades Of Grey) & Will Beall (Gangster Squad).

So yeah, that line sounds about right lol.
Sony hates us, that's the only logical explanation.
Like dust I have cleared from my eye.
Devil’s Rejects meets Alien.
Could you imagine? Carnage spends the movie stalking a group of people and killing them and at the end it is revealed one is Eddie Brock and he gets the symbiote and turns into venom and they duke it out. 

I would be all for this. 
Disney would buy it for any amount. 
Don't forget that practically five minutes after this news broke, Feige came out and said 'The fuck are you talking about?' 
I like how the only thing she's taken from the success of the MCU is that a connected universe is a good way to maximise profit by making people feel like they have to watch every movie in order to keep up.
Amy Pascal can fuck off
I still hate the idea of a Joker origin film. His whole thing is that he genuinely doesn't remember anymore, that his backstory is whatever he wants it to be. The only thing that matters is that night at Ace Chemicals. *That* is the origin of the Joker, cut and dry. An origin story showing how he became a feared crime boss, before he started terrorizing Gotham? I could buy it. But please don't try to canonize failed comedian with pregnant wife.   
>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Tom Hardy

That alone sold this movie for me. 
Yeah but only with spiderman, they ended in good terms after a while and venom became an antihero
Seriously when are we getting an Adam Sandler anime, I thought Netflix was good at linking popular things together to make more popular things.
He was credited as "starring Tom Hardy & Tom Hardy" for *Legend*, and [deserved that dual billing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdZlcF6uJt4).
He is that bloody good isn't he?
That movie is a testament to his acting ability. 
Don't forget Separation Anxiety too!
[He had those powers in Marvel Heroes \(R.i.P\) as well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8FIjUNDH9Q)
Lol i dont know i clearly remember it was quite popular when it released.
Prototype and prototype 2 were fantastic games, I’m shocked they never made any further sequels.
Prototype was a very popular game when it came out with nearly no staying power. 

Prototype 2 tried to capitalize on the success of a game that not many people remembered very well, and was horribly optimized and DRM ridden iirc. On PC at least. The console version was very well received from what I remember. 

The first one though was generally well received but super forgettable. The only thing memorable about that game is the gore and the the fact you had weird mutant super powers. 

Edit: The studio also had large lay-offs post Prototype 2, and activision said that the game didn't find a broad commercial audience, basically saying it wasn't financially worth it. 
Was Spider-Man in that line? 
Bitch I'm a Hopeman.

Eh, halfway into the trailer when he fights the first guys he says "why would *we* do that?"
Because Paul Giamatti.

She wrote the screenplay not the book... Not that that's much better
“Embrace

That has a pretty good ring to it, I’m surprised Sony didn’t go for that. 
They definitely will.

I know we’re here to shit on the trailer but the way it cuts to Charlie mouthing those words behind the camera gets me every time. 

“Vote for me is Democratic thing to do, so do. This doesn’t make any seeEEeense.”
Hell it could have said, "Embrace your venom," and it would have been better than Anti-Hero.
Exactly this thought. "Embrace your inner demon" or something seemed logical but anti-hero is ... awkward.
I love that line, I always hear it in my head in the tone of a petulant 10 year old.

"Monkey!"
He's supposed to be a reporter though. They usually aren't slow & beefy.
I will walk out of this happens. 
Or Tom Hardy will say, "Look, why can't you be more like him?!"
in the trailer Eddie says "If you're gonna stay, we're only gonna hurt bad people" and in the movie it's followed by "like that spider guy" as he looks up and sees a mural of spider-man playing with kids or something
Probably, I'm not nearly familiar enough with it outside of using it for quick checks.

I've always just assumed that it was somewhat regulated. My bad.
My dude, he was in it..... just couldn't see him.
Especially because they're having Eddie find the symbiote first. 

Isn't it always true in every story that it wants to get revenge on Peter for rejecting it?

They'll never work this movie into the MCU even if it beats Black Panther.
I feel like Disney would be the evil empire, it's just that Sony, the scrappy rebels, are actually shit.
The guy who wrote Final Destination 5 wrote Arrival. 

Let that sink in. 

Oh and he wrote The Thing (remake) and A Nightmare On Elm Street (remake). 
Sony didn't understand what they meant when they said 50 Shades of Grey was a "huge tentpole movie."
I hate to judge writers so quickly, but... this isn't building any goodwill for me...
Should've gotten the guys from the Oscar-winning Suicide Squad.
Also written by one of the hacks that gave us The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and The Dark Tower in Jeff Pinkner.

And produced by the idiot that ruined Spider-Man TWICE (and Venom already) in Avi fucking Arad. No idea why Sony keeps that idiot around
I'd rather see him stalk a group of d-list superheroes and just brutally kill them. You could show them thinking they are hotshots protecting the streets at the very beginning, but then they run into Carnage and shit gets real. 
[deleted]
Aren't they adapting The Killing Joke origin though? And the whole point of that was that it could just be a big joke on the origin.
Also went to space with the guardians of the galaxy for reasons
Fucking love that movie
such a great movie. Teaches you a lot about responsibility. I knew a person who had a son and never gave him his last name or anything and continued with his wife and two other sons. 10 years later he was exposed for being a shitty human being and lost his family. Now he's alone.
Man I loved that game
Yeah, prototype and infamous was the shit!
Iirc the studio went under. 

Ninja edit: Nope Wiki says they're still around, but had some large lay-offs post Prototype 2. 

Apparently activision didn't deem it financially viable to make a third because 2 wasn't as successful as hoped or something. At least that's what the wiki page alludes to. 
Yeah but he didn't do much. Got the news that Venom was in San Francisco, went out there to take him down, realized Venom was doing good, helped him take down the other Life Foundation symbiotes, then fucked off back to New York. He wasn't necessary in the story, pretty easy to cut him out.

There was a lot of dumb shit in that story but I'm assuming what they're taking from it is Venom is the original symbiote that bonded to Eddie organically and the Life Foundation took symbiote samples and mutated them and forced them to bind to unwilling hosts to make soldiers (as always) and things go horribly wrong and the hosts have no relationship with their symbiotes so Venom has to fuck their shit up. You can get the gist of it from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom:_Lethal_Protector), the comics themselves aren't a great read but having read them I can see how it definitely lends itself to being easily adaptable into a good movie.
Aren't your parents dead?

Don't worry they'll get it right on the fifth Spider-Man reboot in 2021
Well, this shit is doomed. Pack it up, boys. Let's go home.
It is still so fucking bad. If anyone has not seen it, watching the Funhaus group watching all three of them should say enough about this person. This movie is going to blow due to writing, CGI (where was it in the first trailer?) and weird lines and acting. Tom Hardy seems to be the best thing about this movie at this time. 
Sony exec: IT ROLLS OFF THE TOUNGE!
I don’t know... that transformation looks like the motorcycle scenes conclusion which feels like it’s earlier in the film. Like when Eddie first realizes he’s got this other half driving the car? Could be wrong though 
Embrace your inner rapist
Yes I love that scene. And the fact that Charlie is passionate enough about it that he's mouthing the words to it lol...
"Ohhhhhh shit! Look at that door, dude. See that door there? The one marked "Pirate"? You think a pirate lives in there?"
"embrace your poison"
They need "hero" somewhere in the marketing otherwise people (the average moviegoers not Marvel fans) will think it's a horror flick. 
One day my dad said "Bobby you're 17, it’s time to throw childish things aside" and I said "OK Pop", but he didn't really say that, he said "Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job". 
Which is weird that they're writing him as a wise-guy reporter that says dumb shit like that.
I can't say I've ever remembered Eddy Brock being anything BUT slow and beefy in the comics. At the very least since he originally gained and lost and gained the suit back, he's always had the "Sort of slow on the uptake but just a mountain of muscle" persona going on. He has his moments here and there but that's generally how he's perceived with the suit doing most of the thinking for him.

Edit - It's honestly probably why he was always written as a bad reporter as well to be honest.
Somehow the mental image of that scene happening and some guy just getting up and walking out has me fucking dying
It’s also why Venom has Spider-Man’s powers. Because Peter bonded first.
Sony are the Hutts.
To be fair, the script for The Thing (remake) wasn’t the bad part but more of studio interference and the practical effects being replaced with CGI. 
Seriously? [What the fuck is it doing here now?](https://i.imgur.com/MDhbuT6.jpg)
Sony understood **perfectly.**

There's a 40 minute sex scene in this film and they show *everything*.

At least the bondage scenes will be great
It's never too late for re-writes.

Someone get them on the phone ASAP.
So this is it huh? We just some kinda symBYEote?
Isn't this Avi Arad's passion project? He's been trying to get a Venom movie made for years. Not saying that means it will be good, cause you know, Avi Arad is still involved.

Well I’m not too picky on how I get carnage as long as it’s quality. 
That would be dope
Isn’t the venom that went to space flash Thompson and not Eddie Brock? Wasn’t that venom a straight up good guy?
That was the problem, right there. It came out *alongside* inFamous. 

inFamous: [May 29](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=infamous%20release%20date)

[Prototype]: [June 9th](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%5Bprototype%5D%20release%20date), when everyone was already playing inFamous for 2 weeks. 

Our customers, at least, fuckin' *ate up* the fact that inFamous was an exclusive and only the staff, really, bothered to buy [Prototype].
Holy shit infamous. That's the name
If you read the synopsis of the other story they're deriving the plot from, [Planet of the Symbiotes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_of_the_Symbiotes), you get a sense of where the plot might lead into.

"We need to let the audience know that he is a bad guy, but there's an even more badder guy. How can we do that?"

The climax of the film after that "we are Venom" scene will be him saying, "I am bad, and that's good. I'll will never be good, and that's not bad.

That video didn't show Venom copying spidey's powers though. Tom Hardy was flinging out tentacles from every part of his body.
Oh huh, I didn't know that! 

I figured it could do all the Spider-Man stuff because alien goo can climb walls and swing from tentacles anyway.
I am a HUGE fan of the original thing, and I really didn't think the prequel was that bad. The ending was sort of  shaky, but other than that it was well done. 

I could have used less CGI, but they did not practical effects than most these days.

Embrace your momma
Perfectly reasonable explanation, I'm generally much more articulate in writing than I am with speech, I think most people are. Having time to form your sentences just right is a huge help, obviously.
You know, like Carnage.
It's also why Venom usually has a gigantic spider like image on his chest.
Spider-Man got the symbiote while fighting the secret wars in outer space. Upon return he found it worked as a black suit he could “will” himself into and it would appear, like a fast change of clothes. He enjoyed this and found it gave him extra powers. After some time it started messing with him and he decided to ditch it, that’s when it left him and bonded with Eddie Brock to become Venom. The symbiote keeps traits of its hosts hence Venoms spidey like powers.
And then he smells crime again, he's out busting heads. Then he's back to the lab for some more full penetration. Smells crime. Back to the lab, full penetration. Crime. Penetration. Crime. Full penetration. Crime. Penetration. And this goes on and on, and back and forth for 90 or so minutes until the movie just, sort of, ends....
Bless your heart. 
Oh sweet summer child, you are much, much, MUCH too late.
Notice me Senpaider-Man
THIS IS **VENOM**

HE'S GOT MY BACK
Why couldn't they have just made this a Carnage film? Actually, now that I think about it, the people in charge of that decision probably don't even know that Carnage exists
And kinda why it's name is Venom too. Otherwise it would have called itself something completely different ala Carnage.
Thank you for this. I was too lazy to look up the full quote. You're a five star man. 
I WOULD ADVISE NOT GETTING KILLED BY HIM.

HE'S JUST AN ANTI-HERO AND THIS MOVIE MIGHT NOT EVEN MAKE IT TO PG-13.
I'm still holding out hope that carnage will be the antagonist. Admittedly, we probably would have seen him him this trailer if he was, but whatever.
The word on the street but is that with Woody Harrelson is playing Carnage
