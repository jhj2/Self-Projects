Stupid little prick named white boy Rick huh?
I love the tone of films like this. It just looks so entertaining.
High hopes for this one 
I’ll keep my eye on this. Not turned off by the trailer, but not completely sold just yet.
My man Alfred getting all kinds of roles. He's in that John Wick hotel movie, Widows and now this?
My wife worked on some stuff in the early going of this movie. She said Rick is a really driven and interesting guy\-\-kinda took it upon himself to get this movie made so others would have hope. Obviously he didn't write the script, but once it got bogged down in development he was constantly calling everyone, making sure they didn't forget about him or the movie. Needless to say, me too.
He’s gotta get that paper, boy
that's awesome
