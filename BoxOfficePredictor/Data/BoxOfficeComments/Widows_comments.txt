I remember a redditor once asked if Jon Bernthal has it in his contract that he must be beaten to a pulp at some point in his films. I'm starting to believe that more and more...
That cast is impressive my interest is raised
Brian Tyree Henry and Daniel Kaluuya playing villains together? Take my money now
Hell of a showreel for that ridiculously stacked cast.
This looks fantastic. The cast is incredible. Goddamn PaperBoi is in it!!! With that Nov release date I won't be surprised if FOX think this has some Oscar potential.
The trailer was absolutely enthralling and the cast is stacked as hell! Looks like McQueen's got himself another hit.
THIS CAST. THE DIRECTOR. THE WRITER. HANS ZIMMER SCORING. I’m ready. 
This looks tight as hell. What an amazing cast, and I'm excited to see what McQueen does with the thriller genre.
Whoo. Viola makes one hell of a lead. This is gonna be good.
I read that as "Windows" and thought it was a jab at Microsoft but was pleasantly surprised with a interesting movie trailer.
Looks really good, it is nice to see Michelle Rodriguez in a movie other than Fast and Furious Franchise.
Anyone looking for the song.

[Billie Holiday - "Yesterdays \(Junior Boys Remix\)](https://youtu.be/gZkZJiOEvKM)
That trailer was just art! This how you make an enticing trailer.
Idk what it is man but everyfuckingtime I see Viola Davis in a movie I fell like I can tip over a fucking dump truck. The way she was giving that speech just motivated the fuck out of me . I got to go do something
God I hope the movie is as tense as this trailer because this trailer is amazing.
I thought this said Windows and was excited for Viola Davis to have another installment in her “parts of houses” film series after Fences.
Jesus fucking Christ, it's not even 10am and we've already gotten trailers for this and Suspiria. Let's keep this train rolling. Is that new Jennifer Kent joint far enough along for a trailer? Bad Times at the El Royale, maybe?

Shit goddamn, though, I didn't think I'd care about this film, but I have done a total 180.
This looks **badass**. And I kind of love of how grainy as shit it looks. Is McQueen shooting on Technoscope like he did with *Shame* or Super35 with *12 Years A Slave*? Either way, I'm 100% sold.
This the 2018 'Set It Off' and I'm here for it! 
Colin Farrell, Viola Davis and Hans Zimmer music. I am in. 

All female Suicide Squad. :)
Looks like this is based on a British TV series of the same name... [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows\_\(TV\_series\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_(TV_series))

\(Be careful that link will probably contain spoliers\)
I’ve been waiting since July 19th, 2013 for this day 
Wow, Viola Davis yet again gives me goosebumps, and just from a trailer! Seems like the movie is going to be filled with amazing performances, can't see how it can disappoint. 
Oceans 8 is looking crazy intense y’all
Looking solid af BUT thanks to F&F series when i saw Michelle Rodriguez i go like '...' anyway i have high hopes for this one.
Looks incredible.
Oscar nomination for Viola!

And great fucking cast!
The cast alone will get me to the theater. 
ooooooooh i love trailers that just use a killer slow soundtrack and no diagetic sound.

Like the Battle LA trailer. Bonechilling 
I hope they really play out the intensity of the scene where Viola pulls the gun out and is short of breath. That looks like a good one.
Daniel Kaluuya's mannerisms look insane. If he can bring some kinetic energy to his dialogue, he is going to be a force in this movie.
Love the portrayal of Chicago shown in the trailer. Minus one or two obligatory shots of Lake Michigan, most of the film seems to take place in areas west of downtown. Reminds me a lot of Michael Mann's Thief (also shot in Chicago) so much that it must have been one of McQueen's inspirations. 

Also, I'm one of the few that's yet to be impressed by a performance from Daniel Kaluuya. Looks like he's given a cool villain role for this movie; hope he nails it. 
that was a really good trailer. Viola Davis always seems like a fucking badass in trailers, damn.
Will this be his first project without his personal de Niro, Michael Fassbender? 
Damn what a trailer, can’t wait to check this out 
Holy shit this cast......

I will be first in line.  Hope it's good but then again it's Steve McQueen.  The guy is stellar.
*Letty!*
oooooooh this that one when Neesons robbed them banks tho?

*that's my shit*
So, surprise Michael Fassbender at some point, right?
Between this MI6, and Peppermint, the back half of 2018 is going to be a blast.
The trailer looks more like a traditional genre flick than I would expect from McQueen. I suspect he's hiding the more introspective nature of the film but even if this is accurate, I want to see what McQueen does with a crime flick. If he maintains his track record, he's on the path for being held alongside the all time greats.
What is this, some kinda Suicide Squad?
Me:  "Windows?  What type of dumb movie is this?"
oh shit that looks badass!
Yes please!
There are so many reasons this has become one of my most anticipated films of this year
I thought this said "Windows" and was looking forward to the long awaited Microsoft musical.
Look out world here we come, here comes windows 3.1!
Oh this is gonna be good
Excited to see Robert Duvall!
I’m sorry, but in the first ten seconds of seeing this post, I read “Windows” and thought that this was a Bill Gates movie
Yooo it’s so dope rooting for Kaluuya In Get Out, then kind of not fucking with him in Black Panther, and now seeing him as a full on Villain. 
I see Colin Farrell and John Kaluya in the same movie, yes plz 
jacki weaver is chills!

is kaluuya breaking out the shakespeare villain
Holy shit. This looks so badass.
Cynthia Erivo has been destroying Broadway and I hope she gets to showcase her talents here. I am so hyped for this movie.
The talent involved is incredible, but this seems like “Set It Off” with a big budget. I figured McQueen’s next project wouldn’t be so....conventional.
Trailer looks really good, but I found the "nobody thinks we have the balls to do it" line really unnecessary. It's pretty obvious that 'bad-ass female heist' is the premise, without such stupidly obvious exposition. Cast looks phenomenal though.
Not what I thought this film was going to be, but I'm intrigued! 
They filmed a scene in a jewelry shop next to the doctors office my mom works at. Didn’t see it in the trailer though. 
Viola Davis - directed by Steve McQueen, with all the badassery of Steve McQueen.
This cast though...
What's the badass song in the trailer?
Looks very good
Damn I had no idea about this movie. What a cast! 
This looks dope as hell. 
Steve McQueen. I'm in.
Who is "narrator"? Voice sounds familiar, is it Kevin Hart? 
This looks dope AF. Great director, great cast, and probably a great story. I love seeing transformative black film.
HYPE. So in. This looks amazing. 
After watching an episode of Atlanta, I burst out laughing seeing Paper Boi looking the badguy
This movie will be a real asset in 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon.
Can't wait to see how much of an asshole Jon Bernthal's character is in this.
anyone else thought this was a   dramaticized retelling of the story behind Microsoft Windows
God DAMN that cast looks ridiculous. That alone could have sold me but the fact that Steve McQueen is directing makes it all the better.


Fingers crossed Jon Bernthal gets more than ten minutes of screen time.
This looks like the Oceans remake they should have done. 
If Jon Bernthal is in something, I'll see it. 
Viola gettin arm muscles. here. for. it.
Just look at that crew! This has the potential to be GOAT
Steve McQueen hasnt made a bad movie. This cast and creatives, I am very very excited.
This looks like how a film done with woman should be done I'm hyped for it
Went in expecting a drama trailer given the title and came out super excited. This looks killer, I'm 100% there day 1 with my friend. 
I can already tell that this is going to be one of my favourites of the year. I am so excited to see McQueen adapt his visual poeticism in a gritty crime drama.
Holy. That film is stacked. Each one of those actors is full on. McQueen is incredible. 
"Windows has experienced an error and will now shut down"
Happy to see that Viola Davis is continuing her resolution to avoid typecasting at all costs. I was worried that she'd get nothing but Amanda Waller-ish roles.
Oh shit. 
Nice to see a movie focussing on women that isn't a derivative of a make focused movie. Looks good.
This cast is fantastic!
Michelle Rodriguez and Heist and FAMILY
I thought the title was "Windows" and was expecting a movie about Microsoft. This looks much, much better.
debicki deserves serious awards for THE TALE
***FCK YEAH!***
Anyone know what this was shot on? McQueen's last movie 12 Years A Slave was shot on Arriflex on Super 35 (spherical). But this looks like digital.
I can't wait for this to be unbelievably slow.
Remember reading about this movie about a year ago and thought it had potential.

Trailer is fucking good and seeing ALL of these actors together makes me really excited. Steve McQueen hasn't made a bad movie so far and Flynn can be a great writer when she has good material. REALLY optimistic about this one.
Been waiting on this one. Hope it's not a flop 
I thought this has something to do with Microsoft buying GitHub :/
Who's here for the cast!
So they're making a movie based on [the American Dad episode?](https://youtu.be/mZsDhKDwzSE)
My husband is one of the EMT's in the trailer at 1:24 :)
Now this is how you do female empowerment. By not tearing men down, but appreciating them and writing well rounded female characters. 

Looks really good!
Damn this is exciting. Steve McQueen stretching his legs a bit n making something that seems quite different than his usual super heavy shit. Probably won't be an Oscar contender, but looks like it'll be an amazing thrill ride.
OMG Mr.Beast said that windows is gay
I read this as "Windows", and my brain crashed.
Calling it, Michelle Rodriguez dies in this movie. She always dies. She's the female Sean bean. 
This looks way better than any all female cast reboot/remake out there. An original, strong women film, that looks to have strong supporting male characters too.

This is a must see on my list!
I'm waiting for this...especially to see my favourite stars Viola Davis,Michelle Rodriguez and Liam Neeson on screen.
He pulls this off, I'll finally be convinced that Steve McQueen is the second coming of Michael Mann.
I dismissed this when I first heard of it cause it sounded a bit silly, but I love McQueen so I tried to be optimistic. Looks like a total blast and I'm all in. Crazy amount of talent involved with this too.
Now this is something I can get hyped about, not that Oceans 8 shit.
OH GAWDAMN! TAKE MY MONEY NOW!
Wasn't expecting this at all, was expecting Oscar bait extravaganza.
So many incredible shots. Great cinematography. Intense cast. Steve McQueen never disappoints. 
Paper boi, paper boi, all about that paper boi
Wow, this looks dope as hell. I’m so in. 
"Widows" AKA "\(Re\)set It Off"
My question is, why did Steve McQueen make this movie? From his other three movies, it feels like he chooses projects where either he or the material or both have something specific to express. Which is to say, he seems most interested in transporting the audience into the visceral and emotional reality of his characters \- a man dying of hunger, a man suffering from sex addiction, a man taken into slavery.

This just feels like an action movie. I'm sure his talents will elevate it above standard fare, but I still don't know why he decided this was the right movie for him.
McQueen knows how to cut a trailer. 
Why do they need to make Ocean's 8 when they can make something like this instead? 

Was...that the same actress who played Amanda Waller in Suicide Squad?
Marvel is really thinking outside the box with their new Black Widow movie.
Oceans 8 looks like a direct to DVD compared to this 
This seems a much better way to do a womens movie rather than just replacing actors in previous franchises.
Why don't they do more shit like this and less remaking of Ghostbusters and Ocean's movies?
Is this a sequel to fences?
Wait, someone went out and made a real movie shot on actual film? With, like, an actual cinematographer?? 
I eagerly anticipate the 3-for-1 screenings of Fences, House, and Windows once the trilogy is complete.
trailer looks amazing. so good i stopped half way since i didnt want to ruin the movie 
Whats this? A plausible female ensemble heist scenario? Hope its as good as it looks!
This movie is full of movie stars!
Holy cast
Glad to see him return 
This PC bullshit is going too far this time! Casting a woman as Bill Gates?! This is too mouch!
Damn. 
The movie has everything I want to watch in a film. 
[deleted]
Will watch. Much more excited for this than Ocean's 8.
[deleted]
"I mean Jon your character already dies in this, isn't that enough?"

"NO! I need face punching!"
He's the anti-Sean Bean.
As long as he grunt screams, I am there
Given the premise, it looks like this is another movie he's gonna be in for 10 minutes max.
Maybe that's his fetish.
McQueen is one of the most underrated / overlooked directors by the general masses working.

12 Years got it's due recognition, but Shame and Hunger were so overlooked. He is brilliant. 
Kaluuya seems menacing as fuck and I am *here for it*.
Paper Boi & W'kabi!
Seriously just that moment alone had me sold 
Right?!?!?! That shot of them in the graveyard just got me HYPED.  
Kaluuya has come a long way since [Parking Pataweyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO7yr_RkWlM)
Coupled with a director who has proven over and over again that he knows exactly what to do with a camera and a writer who knows how to write a nail biting plot that will leave you reeling even after the end credits roll. This entire movie has talent from top to bottom and from in front of the camera and behind it. 
I'm just so happy to see a movie with a fresh plot and an all female lead cast that isn't rehashing an old male-driven franchise. 
One movie with so many badass-type actor/actresses
Two Australians in the cast:

Jacki Weaver, with two Academy Award nominations, is in the trailer for a split second.

Elizabeth Debicki, who might have 0.0001&#37; name recognition among the general public, is the first face in the trailer screenshot.

What's up with that? \(Weaver is 71 and Debicki is 27\)
This has a real Tarantino-style feel where the cast is stacked and is definitely going to be Oscar-bait, and yet it actually looks like it’s going to be awesome and fun. 
Earn is stepping up his gigs game.
He's in the new Barry Jenkins movie coming out this year, and is nominated for a Tony! He's fucking killing it.
All about that paper boy.
I mean, Steve McQueen hasn't missed yet.
McQueen’s last movie won Best Picture, so it would be dumb of Fox not to push for awards.
This genre won’t get much buzz from the oscars . If it does some how , I will be overjoyed 
I hope this movie makes some big bucks. The regular moviegoers need to know about McQueen. They have some fast cuts to make it a cool trailer but Mcqueen is gonna bring his style 
I read your post in an old timey radio voice and enjoyed it.
And it's a Regency production. Somehow Arnon Milchan got his head out of whatever sand it was in during the "Big Momma's House"/"Epic Movie" era and started producing classics again.
A cast so impressive I don't care Steve McQueen is finally able to pull himself away from Michael Fassbender.
At the hands of Steve McQueen , she’s gonna be giving one of the best performances of the year 
Everyone in it!
Funny enough, when the original show was originally adapted for the US tv market from the UK, it was called "Windows."
Glad I wasn't the only one. I was thoroughly confused until halfway in. 
She was also in the highest grossing movie of all time (Avatar).
Ahem...*Machete*
But does she still play the same Michelle Rodriguez character that she plays in every movie?
Michelle Rodriguez in a movie other than Fast and Furious

Girlfight 
I’d like to see her in a movie where she’s not playing the same fucking character. “Stoic Hispanic bad ass”. 
I was happy when her character died in Lost. 
Thanks dude!
Steve McQueen is a master, I have no doubt that the movie will be just as tense, if not more so, than the trailer. 
nope sorry you're gonna get an illumination Grinch trailer 
It's unclear what else might be coming today, but this week we're getting trailers for How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, Steven Knight's thriller Serenity, and Lenny Abrahamson's Room follow-up The Little Stranger. So yeah, the trailers this week are gonna rock.

Plus there's a chance for trailers for Mortal Engines, Halloween, First Man, and Bumblebee, all of which are expected in the next month or so.
> we've already gotten trailers for this and Suspiria

Coincidentally, both remakes.
Totally love the look. I was getting tired of the neon Blade Runner look. This is way more in line with like Vanishing Point or The Friends of Eddie Coyle.
Damn that's right. I forgot about that movie. Jada, V.A.F. & Latifah.
Yes, but in this film she's playing a badass, so it's something new for her.
His first *feature film*, yes. Prior to Hunger, McQueen made art films that would only screen in galleries. [Here's one example](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/98724).
did you like his tv series Broken Trail ?
spittin image of winslet character from Triple Nine
12 Years was fairly conventional. Steve McQueen isn't generic and Gillian Flynn is incredible. Gone Girl had an amazing screenplay. So I have a lot of faith in this film. I'm imagining there's only going to be two action setpieces in this entire film: The fucked up heist in the beginning and the widows' heist. The rest is going to be Gillian Flynn drama at its finest.
[Billie Holiday - "Yesterdays \(Junior Boys Remix\)](https://youtu.be/gZkZJiOEvKM)
we grew up at mid niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight

we were only kids then
I'm sure there's going to be a stark emotional reality to this too in some way just like his other films. 
I mean, he could just be trying something new. Or he wanted to work on something with some level of "fun"
there are 85 superhero movies a year, there can’t be 2 heist movies (with wildly different tones) starring women?
Do you seriously not know who Viola Davis is outside of Suicide Squad?
well i been standin with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

got 18 years my life  standin same spot as you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How so?
Thanks for sharing! 
He’s smart as hell. He gets himself into this great projects in this small but great roles . Keeps himself memorable . His one scene in Wind River was fantastic . 
It's called Widows. He's def Beaning in this one.
RUSSOOOOOO
It would technically be a kink.
Shame and Hunger had me convinced he was a Catholic Irish director. It wasn't until I saw him doing an interview for 12 Years A Slave that I realized he wasn't one. 
Shame is one of my favorite films of all time. So hard to watch though.
Shame is incredible. 
So does Brian Tyree Henry. He's such a brilliant actor. I'm so happy that he's breaking through to the mainstream. He's such an excellent actor and all around cool dude.
I really do think he is one movie choice away from going over Get Out and actually winning an Oscar. He's just that good. That part of the trailer where he lies flat on the floor and smiles is so good!
That's *Oscar Nominated*, Daniel Kaluuya. 
Jordan Peele, Ryan Coogler and now Steve McQueen. This is so far an amazing phase in his career and i hope he continues the streak. Spike Lee next perhaps? 
love his stare 
Seems he's really about his paper too
Alfred & Chris!
Yeeeah, it’s surreal to look back on his early comedy days when he worked with Jason Lewis too!
Also, Hans Zimmer
You just know a Steve McQueen directed action setpiece is going to be a sight to behold. We get the deep, personal drama we'd expect from a McQueen film along with some awesome action to boot.

And with Flynn writing the script, I also expect some pretty dark and biting humor. Gone Girl did a great job balancing it's dark subject matter with some legitimately hilarious moments.
Yup.  This is gonna be something like BR2049 or Doubt where you’ve got huge names in every part of the production so there’s little to no room for any leakage in quality.  Even with this trailer I have no idea what to expect but I know it’ll be unique and powerful.
Haha my husband was a background extra for the movie and made it into the trailer- he's one of the medics at 1:24 :). He helped with the medical consulting in that scene too and said it was a wonderful crew
So, Annihilation? 
I got a real Set It Off vibe from the trailer.  No complaints though.
Technically it's just rehashing an old female-driven franchise as it is a remake of an old British series. 
Do you think it looks Oscar bait? This is the least Oscar bait looking thing Steve McQueen has ever put out. It does look awesome though.
tarantino style? oscar bait? hmmmm dont see  the correlation 

A Tarantino-feel, really? Where did you get that from?
I assume you're not familiar with McQueen's work. His films are pretty from Tarantino and I have no idea what gave you that impression from the trailer.
If anything I had expected Oscar bait and this trailer showed me entirely otherwise
Just reminded me I still gotta finish the last two eps of season 2 😂😂
That’s now 3 movies he’s in I’m looking forward to seeing. The other is Hotel Artemis. 
Likewise. I stumbled across the Wikipedia article for this film a year ago and have been waiting for it ever since.
*Surprise Michael Fassbender cameo* 

..I wouldn't even be mad. 
Michael Fassbender pulled himself away from making good movies.
Do we not like Michael Fassbender now?
He's too busy starring in Kung Fury to appear in this movie. 
I keep forgetting that movie happened and I don't know why.
For all of like 10 minutes, with horrible dialogue, and she dies... lol
Don't forget about one of the greatest action franchises of our time, Resident Evil...../s

Yep, Halloween, Mortal Engines and Bumblebee trailers tomorrow.
Much obliged. I'll take a look-see 
This short was my first exposure to him. I thought it was Steve McQueen the actor and was very confused when I googled him to see what more he’d done. 
I only watched the first two Godfather films.
You never heard, there’s a quota for one female led film a year. Otherwise it’s “SJW REEEE WHITE MEN GENOCIDE”. 
I watch so many movies, TV shows, and anime that its hard to keep track of everything. I wouldn't be surprised if I've seen her before Suicide Squad but its hard to remember.
[deleted]
Awesome in Wolf of Wall Street as well. 
Probably one of the rarer Bernthal roles where he doesn't play a scumbag.
Or, and spoiler alert, the husbands all just took off with the money and never died.
He also died in Wind River. So...
Yooooo I just googled him because of your comment and holy shit 
Definitely not a relaxing film. 
Absolutely! I'm bummed I didn't get a chance to see him in Lobby Hero on Broadway.
I'm thrilled for him but damn.....this could be the end for Atlanta the way these guys are blowing up. 
I'm loving his choices since Get Out. He played such a nice good guy in Get Out( and his popular role in Black Mirror, to a certain extent ) it's cool to see him take on some villainous roles like this and W'Kabi in Black Panther.

He looks so dope in this.
Man he's been acting and writing in UK TV for so long. Comedy and drama. He's just a great talent and he's never seemed the type to care about the fame or accolades.
He already got nominated for Get Out so that’s kinda a pointless/redundant statement
He also had a minor part in Sicario! 
I'd like to see him work with Barry Jenkins.
Different kind of director but he also got to work with Charlie Brooker early on in Black Mirror
Hype level: *Inception Horn Noise*
Hans Zimmer scored this? This just went from a 10 to 15. 
Meh, could take it or leave it.

Interstellar was a pleasant surprise though, because of how different his team took it.

I'm not gonna have my hopes up for this one's soundtrack
The fact that this is the most accessible film that McQueen has directed also makes it very interesting. 
Damn you got me there. I saw that on my birthday, don't know how it slipped my mind, I've just been seeing an overwhelming amount of trailers for the new Oceans movie.
I loved that movie, my blood boils that SJW's didn't come out to promote it like they did with the awful Ghostbusters remake, Annihilation had an all female cast that was spectacular but then bombed in theaters.
I think he just means the stacked cast. Which is hardly a uniquely Tarantino thing but whatever.
It’s a wiki page that has too much hype . McQueen with a Flynn script and this stacked stacked cast . I’m probably seeing it multiple times in theater .  I’ve got mad respect for McQueen but his work isn’t that rewatchable . Shame sticks with me in a certain way where you can rewatch but not Hunger or 12 years because they’re a bit harder to watch. This movie is right up one of my favorite genres and looks great 
Matt Damon will not allow that.
*"peekabo!"*

&nbsp;

*"get off the fucking set!"*
:/
No, it's just he's expected to show up in a McQueen movie. There's nothing surprising about it. Like if it's a Nolan film, there's a good chance Michael Caine will pop up. Or if it's a Tarantino film, you are not shocked to see Samuel L. Jackson. There are directors who have their seemingly good luck charm actor. For McQueen it's Fassbender. 
He hasn't been in a good movie since MacBeth. He needs to fire his agent.
I love Michael Fassbender more than members of my own family. And yet the cast is so good, I'm not especially disappointed he isn't in this.
X-Men: Dark Phoenix 
Cause it wasnt that good or memorable of a movie
Forget all that noise avatar is good. We keep forgetting it because it’s more of an experience than a movie. So when we talk about movies we don’t think of it.
because james cameron is a hack, and instead of making more movies based on fern gully, he decided to dick around with the money whilst promising more avatar movies "soon" (2020 it looks like, who knows!)

oh and hes making a true lies tv show too, wow! great job
And the action packed movie Swat! Alongside the greatest rapper turned actor, LL Cool J
You mean to say you watch so many movies and TV shows that you don't know the Academy Award/Emmy Award winning actress Viola Davis? 
Do you *pay attention* to the movies you're watching? Davis has a memorable screen presence.
Right but how is it garbage tho?
He's awesome in pretty much everything. Loved him in season 2 of daredevil. He deserved a nom for that 
I lost my shit, when you see him pumping weigths like a badass and selling quaaludes and then he asks "Hey ma, we got chicken or what?" 
You expect him to be the asshole but you get so much more in that small 10 minute window
this
He didn't die in Sicario, just got the shit kicked out of him. 
He might be neither Catholic nor Irish - but he truly *gets* us like I've never seen a foreigner do without some family connection. It still boggles my mind that anyone who hadn't been raised Catholic could make Shame. I guess we don't have a monopoly on unhealthy attitudes to sex.
Dude same!! Brian Tyree Henry AND Chris Evans! Oh, what a dream.
Well, didn't Glover do an interview not too long ago on how he wasn't finding Atlanta to be 'as creatively stimulating' and was 'starting to look towards other projects' anyway? 

I can't wait to see where everybody ends up!!
All good things must come to an end. I'm not worried about Atlanta though. It's one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV. They'll make time for it.
He was my favorite nomination this year! His eyes, dismayed with the lies of the one he loved, the cold betrayal, and the fear of society ready to lynch him metaphorically, was so well acted. That moment when he's choking Rose, and the sirens blare, our heart drops with him. He sold that scene so well. Kaluuya is fantastic in my eyes.
Wouldn't say he was necessarily a villain in BP. Just fighting for a cause he believed in. I get that he was villainous in the sense that he was going against the protagonist, but he still had morals.
I was always amused seeing him during the awards run for Get Out. He consistently seemed like he just didn't want to be there for any of it. Not in a disrespectful way, just like a 'This isn't really what I'm doing this for' kind of way.
He's honestly a pure revelation. Plain and simple!
It's not redundant. I am just stating that I can actually see him win one. He's that good to get nominated again.
And Johnny English Returns!
Brooker isn't a director.

That being said, I absolutely love his writing.
[BWONG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2jUhnCU9iA)
I am also quite aroused.
SJWs?  Really?  If you're talking about tumblr I saw plenty of praise for it there.  It's general audiences that don't see things they don't recognize.
After the performances Fassbender gave in Hunger and Shame, can you blame him?
 if it's a Nolan film, there's a good chance Michael Caine will pop up

would you watch ww2 movie just caine on screen as RAF announcer ?
I thought he did fine work as Steve Jobs - but yeah, that's about the same vintage. I do think Shame was his most recent truly great performance though.
Counterpoint: Maybe he has a good agent that just gets shitty films to pay him huge money and he just doesn’t care if the movie sucks anymore.  The last non X-Men movie he didn’t have highest billing in was Slow West in 2015, which he produced.  And before that it was Frank which he got particular acclaim for.  Basically my point is the $35m budget for The Snowman had to go somewhere.
Frank came out after MacBeth. But yeah, he's had quite a few stinkers lately.
Kerryman accent on him though.

(I kid. Love Kerry accents; they're hilarious)
I remember it blowing my mind in the cinema and then putting me to sleep on Blu-ray. Hopefully number 2 is better.
it was good but today we need 8 sequels to be released every year for people to remember it e.g. mcu
Well - all the reasons it was notable were behind-the-scenes reasons. 
it wasnt a movie it was an experience /s
such bullshit.
I never really give a shit if they've won awards or not. If I've seen her before she probably didn't leave much of an impression on me.
Obviously not that memorable if I can't remember if I've seen her in anything other than Suicide Squad.
And Season 1 of Punisher, Fury, and the first 15 minutes of Baby Driver. He's like the King Midas of acting. 
That.
And a wet Willy!
Oh it was. I saw it a couple weeks ago and BT Henry fucking KILLED IT (as did Cera, Evan's and Powley)
Zazie Beetz said she has read some scripts for the third season. Sooooooo
[deleted]
The way you phrased it makes it sound like Get Out is some kind of hurdle to him getting an Oscar when it’s actually the exact opposite.

Everyone knows he can win one.
That wasn't a minor part!
Right, I could have sworn he directed the first season of Black Mirror and Dead Set. My mistake!
Nope. Not one bit. One of the hardest parts of making a movie is the casting. If you find an actor that is just an absolute joy to work with AND makes you look good, you hold onto that person and never let them go. 
Don't forget his performance from 12 years a slave.
Hunger is his best performance to date IMO, and he has a ton of really great work out there.
After the way Fassbender was swinging in Shame, can you blame him?
Steve Jobs came out right around that same time as MacBeth, yeah. 2015 was his last good year: MacBeth, Slow West, and Steve Jobs. He should have won the Oscar for Steve Jobs over Leo, btw.

But yeah, he's been in crap since then.
He did fine work in Covenant and Cianfrance's The Light Between Oceans too. Both Vikander and Fassbender give superb performances. It's also worth mentioning his turn in Trespass against us,an indie that went almost unnoticed but he and Brendan Gleeson are fantastic. 
It just wasn't deep or profound. It excelled visually. And a lot of movies do excel visually. 
Ok, have you seen any of the following?

* Doubt

* Solaris

* Fences

* Prisoners

* The Help

* Blackhat
Yep and “Me, Earl and The Dying Girl” and Sicario are another two . The list of filmmakers he’s working with through these films is great . 
I am not fangirling. You really sound condescending as you tell me to tone down. I am noticing something that obviously you didn't see. I saw a menace in the trailer. You sound incredibly judgemental of someone who wrote a comment that you found "ludicrous" and judged me as a zealous fan. 
All I said was that if he can outdo his performance for GO, which he could, he's instantly a winner. He was almost there. I think he and Chalamet were both better than Oldman.
I didn't. His performance in 12 Years A Slave was very good, but the part didn't require or allow nearly as much nuance as his roles in the other two films. 
his best performance to date IMO

Fish Tank
I enjoyed his performances in Alien Covenant.
He's still done good work even in those silly films. And I'm sure they pay well. 
Brendan Gleeson is always fantastic - and so are his sons, mostly. They're like an Irish version of the Skarsgård family. 
You are right. You could sit around with a couple friends and write that story.
Most of those movies were just bad and I wish you didn't remind me of them especially blackhat...god that movie was shit.
Yeah, that I completely agree with, your phrasing just threw me off in the original comment.  Honestly DDL and Rob Pattinson were better than Oldman too.
I’d disagree. I believe that Fassbenders role
In 12 Years a Slave was much more complexified and nuanced than many other portrayals of slave owners in other films, particularly with his dynamic with Patsy. 
Frank. 
But then y'all would stop because everyone would be like "This is just Pocahontas, let's do something else."
Lmfao!! I love this guy.
Likes anime and also thinks Prisoners is "just bad." It's an objective 8 at the minimum. The best film on that list and one of the best of the 2010s.

And if ur just baiting then okay.
Robert Pattinson got the "Fuck you, Jake Gyllenhaal" treatment (not nominating him for Good Time the way they didn't nominate Gyllenhaal for Nightcrawler). They can't get over the fact that he's not his Twilight character!
More complex and nuanced than other portrayals of slaveowners, sure. I'm not knocking it, it was a very good performance. But he wasn't the protagonist and very few actors can hold a candle to the work he did in Hunger and Shame. Topping those two would be a monumental achievement. 
Not baiting because I found most of those movies to either be bland boring oscar bait while others had some lackluster writing. I don't mind movies that don't have a lot of action but its hard to find the right kind of actor/actress that can keep you interested.

As for the anime comment you're obviously someone who doesn't watch it so don't go passing judgement. Some anime have been huge influences on directors and actors in hollywood like Guillermo Del Toro and actor Keanu Reeves being just some of the notable examples.
Honestly I don’t think 90% of people in the Academy even knew *Good Time* existed.  Blame A24 for that one I guess.  At least it’s already rightfully a cult classic among the people who actually care about good movies.
Finding a film boring really is on you. 

I enjoy Miyazaki.

Let me guess tho... you like Mad Max and John Wick?
