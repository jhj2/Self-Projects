His Lifetime Achievement special when that handicapped kid comes out to surprise him is the best thing ever. 
I can’t wait to see this. If you haven’t already seen the documentary on amazon called Mr.Rogers & Me, watch it. It’s a pretty great behind the scenes made by two brothers that got to know him in his later years. 
I saw this Film at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival opening night! I was a wreck watching it because it filled me with so much feeling. I couldn't describe how much I missed just hearing his voice & concern with children. 

There was a Q&A afterwards with the entire film crew & Yo Yo Ma's son, Nicholas Ma, who was a Producer for the Film. When asked why none of Fred Roger's sons went into children's programing, Nicholas Ma said that's why he isn't a successful concert cellist. 

It truly is a wonderful Film that doesn't paint his life only with the positives but the sides that make him a human. He had his struggles & conflicts but that only made his resolve stronger. They filmmakers should all be very proud of their work!
If a statue of Fred Rogers ran for president in 2020, I'd quit my job to campaign for it.
The best of us.

My dad passed away when I was 6 years old.  Mr. Rogers helped fill that void.
"Mr. Rogers? I want to tell you something. I like you."

OMG, too frickin' sweet!
Me: "A trailer has never made me cry"

*Won't You Be My Neighbor*: "Hold my sweater"

Edit: Credit /u/holyone666 for the much better "Hold my.."
I had a pretty good childhood, but there was a time when I was pretty miserable. I had to stay with my grandparents and my grandmother—well, the nicest thing I can say about her is she wasn’t nice. On top of that, I was going through a rough patch at school where I was being bullied.  

I still remember that half-hour of being Mr. Rogers’ neighbors each day, and how I felt loved and special during that time. It would be like that was my goal each day—just make it until Mr. Rogers came back on. 

Anyway, today just hearing “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” will make me cry. So, I’ll be happy watching that when it streams, but I don’t want to go out in public crying, so I’ll pass on the theater release. 
I will always upvote Mr. Fred Rogers.
I don't know how I'm supposed to get through that.  I can barely get through the trailer without weeping.  Fred Rogers was the closest thing I've ever seen to Jesus Christ on TV.
I'm not a native speaker, not from the US and haven't ever seen a single episode of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood - but I've come to learn *of* him over the years, and have watched a good deal of clips.


...It was just surreal. At first I thought *"He cannot possibly be genuinely* ***this*** *loving and caring and nice of a person, but wow, what a great thing he's doing for the kids"*. As I learned and watched more and more, I realized he apparently *was* exactly as open, kind, caring and *unconditionally* loving as he appeared... and when I realized that, and I watched him express his love and appreciation knowing that he *truly* meant every part of it from the bottom of his heart, it broke through every emotional barrier I had and made me cry for about half an hour.

I'm not in any way religious, and have a deep-seated antipathy for cults of personality - but man, I have rarely ever been moved this deeply by another person - it was a... humbling experience, to witness just how purely good a person can be in this world - with empathy, understanding and love. There's nobody I know (including myself) who wouldn't do well to think about what Fred Rogers did right and how to be more like that...
Man, if this trailer fucked me up as bad as it did, I can't imagine how effective the actual film will be.
There really isn't a better time for this movie to come out. I cannot wait to see this, and I hope it gets the recognition that it will deserve.

Mr Rogers is a saint, and should be recognized as someone of massive importance to the growth of our children, society, and culture.
"In Theatres Summer 2018" 

...BUT I NEED MR. RODGERS NOW! 

Honestly, for the first time in over a year, I felt my heart open up and my body relaxed, even while I also teared, knowing he's gone. I'd like to think what he taught us isn't gone; that we carry it inside us and can give it to another generation. 
It makes me sad that my generation was the last one to grow up with Fred Rogers.  

We did nothing to deserve him.
Happy Birthday, Mister Rogers
Here he is meeting the boy in the wheelchair decades later. The look on Mr. Rogers face is so genuine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcNxY4TudXo
Thanks. Now Im fucking crying.
the world need a man like that today :S 
Wait, so this isn't the one with Tom Hanks?
I couldn't even get through the trailer without crying. I loved him so much. My mom, brother and I used to watch Mr. Rogers Neighborhood every single day together. I'm really sad that kids are growing up without him.

I think he was the first celebrity death that really shook me. I was in college when he died, but I cried. And then I looked up [facts about him](https://www.factinate.com/people/40-facts-neighborly-facts-about-mr-rogers/), I cried again. He truly was one of a kind.
Our PBS station just did their annual fund raising show and had a Mr. Rogers video.  KoKo the gorilla watched him every day.  Mr. Rogers then met KoKo and she took off Fred's shoes....I lost it.

I hope this film is able to spread his spirit to younger viewers who didn't have the chance to see his show when they were little. I lived in Pittsburgh when he passed, and I have never experienced an emotional outpouring like that. The entire city mourned openly, in the most wholesome and friendly ways; people talked about it and hugged each other and talked about the ways he had affected their lives. The whole front page of the paper and most local news for a while was just about him. There was, I think it was at the convention center, a big memorial book that people lined up to write in, just about memories they had or little messages of love and hope.  The person in front of me, a real big, rough guy, wrote "I love you, I miss you, thank you", and walked away crying. He brought people together in a profound way; I wish he were still here. I'm gonna cry my eyes out if I can find a showing of this close to where I live, and maybe even just the trailer will be a good reminder for me to keep that soul of goodness and kindness alive, even when everything seems awful around me. 
Reading through the comments so far I'm happy to read so many emotional responses to the trailer. Doesn't matter what day I go see the movie, rain will be in the forecast.
Wow the trailer alone just tore down my walls.
I loved Mr. Rogers as a kid, although I did always find it kinda funny that he would come in with a sweater, to only change into a different colored sweater. Haha, I loved that show.
Fred Rogers deserved dogs
This makes me so emotional. I feel like we have *completely* lost this world.
Okay, what's the Philip Glass piece that starts around 1:05?

Edit: Or is it Michael Nyman? Some minimalist, anyway.

Edit2: It's Nyman. [The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFRCazQPLbE&index=4&list=PLPANPVrVxoCfb-rnq8UI0qtpChGmIWxcG). Such a great soundtrack, but also about the least Fred-Rogers-ish film I can think of. 
Can’t wait to bawl my eyes out 50 times while watching this!
Oh man I have not been to a theater in probably ten years but I'll be going to that
Why the hell am I crying during **THE TRAILER!!!**
How am I supposed to get through the movie...Jesus christ
gosh i havent choked up in a while and this hit me hard this man was a hero, hell a man among men
I work in a call center AND THIS IS NOT GREAT FOR ME TO BE WATCHING.

Customers can hear me choking up
This belongs on r/wholesomememes it feels so good
If we could all be a little bit more like Fred Rogers the world would be a much more beautiful place.
We need him now more than ever. 
Today would have been Mr Roger's 90th birthday. I currently attend the seminary he did, where he became an ordained Presbyterian minister and today we all wore sweaters and cardigans in his memory. 
I sometimes wonder how maladjusted I'd be if it weren't for Fred Rogers in my life.
One of those movies I might have to go see on a weekday morning so I can cry my eyes out in the theater alone.
Shut up! I'm not crying, *you're crying*!


(ಥ﹏ಥ)


Fuuuuuucccccckkk, I'm definitely crying... 
This man was a very special human being.
I hope that in the 7 billion people out there in the world, there's one person who's growing to become the next Mr. Rogers for a new generation of kids. 
And now I'm crying. 



Thank you Mr. Rogers you beautiful, magnificent saint of a man for letting the world loan you for a while for the betterment of this crazy life we're all living. 
I really have no idea who this man is, but see alot of people saying they cried just from the trailer alone. Could someone maybe explain to me why Fred Rogers is/was so popular?
Now THAT is a man. 
We did not deserve this man.
I lasted exactly 37 seconds before I started crying at my desk. How am I supposed to watch a entire movie if I can't even make it through the TRAILER?
Why am I tearing up at a documentary trailer? What happened to me?
Man that opening announcer is emulating Rod Serling.  Thought this trailer was going to go a completely different way
THE FEELS, I CAN'T.
PBS somehow cornered the market on the kindest souls on earth. Mr. Rogers, Bob Ross and LeVar Burton were childhood for tens, maybe hundreds of millions. They were all so completely genuine in their kindness, gems of humanity.

It can be so very hard sometimes to realize in the heat of the moment. But try and be the person they knew you could be.

I'm sure it'll get linked a bunch here. But if you haven't read this article on Fred Rogers do yourself a favor and take the time. You'll be glad you did, it's genuinely delightful.

We used one of his songs in our wedding speech: 

It's you I like,
It's not the things you wear,
It's not the way you do your hair--
But it's you I like.
The way you are right now,
The way down deep inside you--
Not the things that hide you,
Not your toys--
They're just beside you.

But it's you I like--
Every part of you,
Your skin, your eyes, your feelings
Whether old or new.
I hope that you'll remember
Even when you're feeling blue
That it's you I like,
It's you yourself,
It's you, it's you I like.

It's You I Like
By Fred M. Rogers
I'm a new dad and I look to Mr Rogers as inspiration. I grew up with a mentally unstable mom and a weekend dad. I have tons of anger and anxiety issues that I grapple with every single day and the absolute last thing I want is for my daughter to have to deal with the same crap I did. His patience is what is most impressive to me. Patience is the key to everything. His ability to read a situation and figure out how to handle it from a place of love and compassion is exactly what I want to do. It's such a simple concept and so hard for me to actually do. Everytime I feel myself getting angry at a situation, say my daughter screaming in my ear for the 50th time that day, I have to consciously stop myself and think about the kind of person I want to be in that situation. The better me, the me Mr Rogers would be, is slowly starting to develop. I have good days and bad days but its something I'll never stop working on. I thought Mr Rogers was boring when I was a kid but as an adult I fully appreciate what he stands for. The mans philosophy is relevant at any age. 
In Canada we also had [Mr. Dressup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Dressup) with [Ernie Coombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Coombs).  
I remember talking to Mr Rogers through the television... He was/is/always will be one of my most favorite people. 
What is the music that plays at 1:06? I've heard that before in documentaries...
I would argue that Fred Rogers was the closest thing we have ever had to an embodiment of Christ. He was a Christian that wanted to become a minister but took a detour into children's television. He understood that the best way to share his idea of God was to simply share the message of love, he did not need to evangelize the deity that he fervently believed in. Somehow, he knew that the message of love itself was enough, or even that evoking a deity may have made some uncomfortable or retreat to their own tribal camp. He was so adhered to the message of love the pure inclusion that he broke past any barriers that can divide humanity and shot that arrow straight into the hearts of all that listened. He was the best of us.  We are so much better for having had him.   
For those that are unaware, Mr. Rogers Neighborhood is actually on Amazon Prime video. 
As an adult man, I cannot see this in theaters. I will await the release date for home so I can cry like a giant baby through most of this movie. 
Now all we need is a Bob Ross Documentary that's actually just every Joy of Painting episode back to back into  one massive feature of wholesomeness. 
What a kind and gentle soul. Mr. Rogers always seemed so selfless.

Excited for this documentary, I just wish Tom Hanks' movie was going to be a biopic about Mr. Rogers' life instead of a slice of life moment.
I’M NOT CRYING, YOU’RE CRYING!
Mr. Rogers was ever so much of my childhood (am 38 for reference).  Watching this, plus Sesame Street and the Muppet Show was the core of my upbringing.  Of course there were the smurfs, snorks, GI Joe, Transformers, Gobots etc.... but I can remember the episodes that Mr. Rogers did on divorce, death and sadness way more than I can recall specific episodes of Sat morning cartoons. 

I am having my first child in August and I know for a fact she will be watching old shows of Mr. Rodgers and be a better person for it.


I couldn't watch the whole trailer because I was about to start crying.
You are special 
I’m not crying, you’re crying!
I saw this at True/False. It is a fantastic documentary. Mr. Rogers is truly a saint.
Well I've got a huge lump in my throat now.
Oh my god it gets you right in the feels
I’m crying at my desk 
Chills down my back once the song started
He really was the best of us all.
Obligatory profile of Mr. Rogers: Can you say... Hero: https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/
Mr. Rodgers was the Dali Lama of the US.  I still feel blessed for having met him back in middle school when he came to visit my schools garden.  
He was an amazing person.  Never forget that Fox News called him evil.
Preschool teacher checking in; we all sure as hell could take a page out of Mr. Rogers' book

>children have very deep feelings, just like anyone does

This couldn't be more true. Just because a child spazzes out over his block tower being knocked down doesn't mean his emotions are any less valid than a grown ups. So what if *you* don't think he should be crying about it. The block tower is *all that matters to him* and it was ruined. Imagine if everything you care about is suddenly ruined. That's how that child feels. Everyone deserves to be told they're loved and they matter. 
Made this 44 year old man cry watching that.  Grew up with that man.  His basic message was "Don't be mean", and it was a great one.   
  
Nostalgia from that is crushing.
His reaction was so honest and genuine. As soon as the young man came out he immediately got up and went straight to him. Didn't even use the stairs. 

Fred seemed like he didn't necessarily mind participating in a bit of pomp and circumstance, especially if he was able to use it to spread his love or gratitude, but he never placed the formality normally expected above how he felt and always acted accordingly.

Thank you for mentioning this! I had never seen that video before and got teary instantly when he and Jeff hugged. 
The only quote I’ve ever found that truly encompasses everything about him is 

The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren and to do good is my religion.
~THOMAS PAINE
Thank you so much for mentioning this- I had no idea.
along the same lines, if you prefer a book there is always: "I'm Proud of You: My Friendship with Fred Rogers" by Tim Madigan.
There's a twitch marathon right now playing almost every episode of the show in a row https://www.twitch.tv/misterrogers
Yeah this is definitely a rent'er. Because I ain't crying at the theater.
Nicholas Ma with his dad on the show:  https://vimeo.com/96905052


I saw his kids on some of the episodes.. they were not very enthusiastic
How does one get tickets to these film festivals to see movies so early? Is that like an invitation thing?
Man I'd hate to see how the media would run his name through the mud if he were alive today and said something controversial like "everyone should love everyone."
If re-runs of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood ran for president I'd vote for it. The state of the union address could just be old re-runs. We'd be WAAAAAY better off. 
[Especially this one](http://neighborhoodarchive.com/images/misc/other/fredosaurus_rex/DSCF1298.JPG)
It sounds really stupid but I'm a 30 year old and never really saw at lot of Rogers (I've heard a lot about how great he is, but I'm European so never really heard about him).

I just cried watching that trailer. I haven't cried like that in a long time. I don't know why but his vision of love is just heartbreaking to me in how genuine and fantastic that is. Can there be a better way of treating people as children?


I always got the feeling that John Pastore was a dude who didn't tolerate bull shit to such a degree that when he saw someone give a genuine plea to support something they care about, he was totally taken aback. Glad to see Pastore was willing to listen instead of just go in one ear and out the other.
I think it might be a good idea to present some proper context to the video, because Senator John O. Pastore may be the most unfairly vilified figure in any viral video ever. This video is always presented as "Mister Rogers facing down the gruff, mean anti-PBS politician who's trying to kill quality children's television" and that's really not what's happening at all. The truth is, Pastore was there because he was the biggest advocate PBS had in Washington. Pastore hated children's television offerings by the major networks (he had complained so loudly the previous year that it caused the networks to cancel a slew of cartoons that he deemed unacceptable). He thought public TV needed funding because he thought it was a worthy alternative to commercial children's TV.

Richard Nixon was wary that the Ford Foundation, a group that had funded some fiercely slanted documentaries on public TV in the 1960s, would wield too much influence over the newly-formed Corporation for Public Broadcasting and wanted the budget slashed in half because he didn't want to fund programming that he expected to be anti-Nixon. This hearing was held so that advocates for educational TV could come forward and plead their case that they were doing good work with the government funding they were getting.

Pastore, again, portrayed most of the time as being anti-PBS, actually opened the hearings with this statement: "“The Corporation is now a viable entity. During the short time that it has been in operation, it has made plans for, and in some cases actually begun, providing broadcast programs of diversity and, I must say, excellence; establishing an experimental interconnection distribution project; and supporting and strengthening local noncommercial stations."

And that's the reason he snaps at Mister Rogers early on. He'd made it very clear that he's in favor of continuing to fund the effort. So when Mister Rogers leads off by expressing his concern that Senator Pastore hasn't read the written statement in advance, Pastore reacts with the tone of a guy who's basically thinking, "You get that I'm on YOUR side, right?" As much as we want to think of Mister Rogers as infallible, the truth is, this video shows Mister Rogers committing a bit of a faux pas and Senator Pastore calling him out on it.

As far as Pastore's statement at the end, "Looks like you just earned the $20 million," again, this moment didn't singlehandedly swing anything. It's not Pastore saying "I'm in charge of this $20 million and now you can have all of it!" He's telling Mister Rogers, "Wow, good speech, dude."

So yes, it's a great speech, and yes, Mister Rogers probably did a lot toward ensuring fuller funding for PBS...but Senator Pastore isn't the villain in this video, and Mister Rogers did nothing that changed his mind about anything. Pastore was trying to get the full $20 million grant from the beginning.
[Most of the proceeding of this recording is actually in the film. It's really hard to pull yourself together after watching this mid way through the Film.](#Spoiler)
I've read that Pastore is pretending to be cynical about public broadcasting here, and that he had his mind made up about this and Mr. Rogers was brought out to create this scene to justify his vote to his constituents.  I tried to find a source for this, but google results are just page after page repeating the "feel good" version of the story where he melts the icy heart of the curmudgeon.

This is not an attempt to disrespect Fred Rogers or what he did - I think he was an amazing person.  I just think politics have always been politics, and will always be politics, so I think that explanation is more likely than 10 minutes of testimony flipping a politician on an additional $10 million of funding in 1969.
If he were alive today, I can’t help but feel things would have ended differently.

Edit: I feel you are misunderstanding me. I mean I wish we had a soft, clear, honest voice to speak the truth to this current administration. If he could get that asshole in the senate back in the day to actually care about something, maybe he could get some of today’s senators and representatives to take a look at themselves as well.
My dad when I was 5. This trailer eerily touched on deep forgotten moments. 
My dad is still alive but is a complete bastard. Mr Rogers helped fill that void.
Mine left when I was 4....32 years old sitting at my desk almost crying in the office right now...
Mine left when I was 3.  Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross were huge in filling that void. 
Never knew my dad sonce he died when I was a baby, I would watch Mr. Rogers whenever I could up until I got too old to be spending the night at grandma's.
Right there with you. My dad passed away when I was 4 from cancer. Fred Rogers actually made pamphlets for parents on how to explain to their children about the death of a loved one. During that time, I watched his show almost everyday as a coping method. I watched this trailer and it instantly flooded me with emotion. I might have to wait until this comes out on blu ray cause I'm a weepy, wet mess right now just from the trailer. Don't think I'd be able to compose myself in the actual movie theater.
I have a three year old daughter. She does this all the time, it is adorable. This is what I love about kids -- they are very forthright and let you know how they feel. 
"Hold my sweater"* FTFY
it's a cardigan, but thanks for noticing.
Yup. This is the first trailer that ever made me cry. I have no idea how I'll get through the movie, but dang it, I'm going to try.
I didn't make it past the first fifteen seconds without welling up.
The trailers for Moon and Tree of Life made me cry 
Jeez, yeah my shirt is wet from drying my eyes. 
Thanks for sharing that, brought a tear to my eye. And believe me, you wouldn't be the only person crying in that theater...
You, Me, and about 4 generations.

First episode date: February 19, 1968
Final episode date: August 31, 2001

I had no idea he was on for so long.
Saw it at Sundance. The whole theater left in tears. I mean everyone I saw. Everyone.
So many memories of kind smiles and happy messages, all of which felt like it was directed right to me personally sitting in front of the TV. What a nice guy he was. 
I’m Jewish and I completely agree with you. Fred Rogers was a man of God. 
Yeah, it's why I will wait for it to come to Netflix or Redbox or something. I really don't feel like crying around groups of people.
I can't say I got as far as weeping, but I sure became blurry eyed watching that trailer.  I grew up watching him on TV through the 80s.  I don't think there is a single other person out there in the media, be it for children or young adults, that is able to speak as frankly, and as respectfully, about any single topic.  His ability to help us understand, and empathize, with anyone about anything shaped me as the person I am today and I will forever be grateful for his influence.
He's one celebrity that I'd really vote for president.  
Yeah... I want to go to a movie theatre and cry for 2 hours...
And Fox News hosts called him an "evil evil man."


I'm glad I'm not the only one. 
Im glad this is the top comment, I bawled through out that trailer and wondered wtf is wrong with me.  He was basically my Dad growing up and taught me how to be a good person.  Aaaand now im crying again.
And to think that 90% of his love and good deeds in life were off camera. I wish I’d known someone like him. 
> I'm not in any way religious, and have a deep-seated antipathy for cults of personality - but man, I have rarely ever been moved this deeply by another person - it was a... humbling experience, to witness just how purely good a person can be in this world - with empathy, understanding and love.

Well, shit.  If English isn't your native language, I can't imagine how articulate you are in your primary.
[Relevant xkcd](https://xkcd.com/767/)
I really think he was just being himself on the show.
Thank you for writing what I came here to say. Never saw an episode and everything I know of him is from the internet, specially reddit.
I'm not a religious person anymore either, I don't believe in those things.

But Mr Rogers is pretty much the closest thing we have to a saint.

If there was such a person as Jesus, this is what he would look like, and this is what he would be doing. Not preaching from a lavish mega-church, not shouting doctrine at people who are different, not hoarding wealth or selling a product.

.

I realize a bit of irony, an atheist quoting bible verses, but - 

"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" - Matthew 20:28
I live in Pittsburgh, his home town, and he's basically revered here. There are multiple statues, roads, and a variety of other things named after him. We have all kinds of athletes, political figures, musicians, etc that come through here, but no one has ever come close to the level of fame and reverence that he has...and rightfully so
At work, sound off, still made me tear up with joy. Luckily there is a lot of pollen around so I can play it off.  

Just my allergies *sniff* *sniff* 
I am not by any stretch an emotional man, but anything Mr. Rogers related brings me to tears immediately.
I'm not Catholic or anything but I endorse sainthood nonetheless.
[Have I got some good news for you](https://www.twitch.tv/misterrogers)
I went on a vacation last week to a beach and this video clip did more for my stress level than that whole trip did.
Its kind of amazing a religion hasn't been formed around him. Humble, kind, compassionate. I'm happy to be an apostle.
> I'd like to think what he taught us isn't gone

The first time I saw the opening of Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, I was completely unprepared to have a reaction.  It made me so happy to hear those songs again.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEypinvApHo
It's okay, he likes you just because you're you.
why tf did i watch that?! i'm at work you jerk.

It's staggering to think, especially in times like these, that there ever lived such a person.
Shouldn’t be cutting all these onions while watching that speech. 
The world needs people like that, everyday.

FTFY
Be the change  you wish to see in the world.

😊
If it is, man he really pulled it off.
Correct; this is a documentary.
That would be "You Are My Friend," which _is not_ a biography of Fred Rogers, but is mostly based on the true story of a friendship between Rogers and a reporter, and how knowing Rogers changed the the reporter.

Tom Junod is that reporter.  He wrote about Rogers in 1998 for Esquire magazine, and it was [republished last year](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/).  That article gives at least a taste of what that relationship was like.

While I'm looking forward to this movie, I would also love to see a biopic of Fred's life, focused of course on his television career, because it was so interesting.  Of course, that will be covered in _Won't You Be My Neighbor," so I'm looking forward to it.
This should be higher. I had to find this comment to confirm this. I thought possibly it was a teaser and it hadn’t started shooting with Hanks yet, and they weren’t focusing on Hanks’ casting here.
If it makes you feel any better, there is a show called Daniel Tiger that is based on Mr Rogers' Neighborhood. Also MRN is available on Prime (and lots of people have uploaded episodes to Netflix).

I never really got into Mr Rogers when I was a kid, but my own children watch him very often.
It was way worse in Latrobe.  The collective heartbreak really was fascinating to live through.

 I've never actually walked down to see the marker they put up a couple years ago.  Too bad this north-easter is blowing through already, I would have liked to go see it right now.
He came in with a suit jacket.

The highest praise.
["I know how tough it is some days to look with hope and confidence on the months and years ahead, but I would like to tell you what I often told you when you were much younger. I like you just the way you are. What's more, I'm so grateful to you for helping the children in your life to know that you'll do everything you can to keep them safe. And to help them express their feelings in ways that will bring healing in many different neighborhoods."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OqyUuCY0s)
I feel you are missing his message. It's all about how being a good neighbor (person) you can make small changes that when multiplied create a better world.

Be the best person you can be and help those less fortunate than yourself and the world will be that much better just becouse you are in it.

Don't give up. 
At first I thought, "Why are we all crying? It didn't even show the 'I stamp my feet' clip." 

I think you nailed it, though. This is the world we were aspiring to and now we have... ugh 
I just watched his TV Hall of Fame induction speech and found myself with the same thought... We have utterly failed Mr. Rogers. Oof.
Look into what was going on during the time Mr Rogers was on air.
Mr. Rogers would never say it was too late.
What? The world was a worse place when Mr. Rogers was at his peak. We *have* improved since then. Keep living in the ways that he teaches and, naturally, the world will become a better place. 

And there's no reason not to when you don't see others around you doing the same.
[Michael Nyman - Fish Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzpvJT3t3u8)
Be the person he believed you are.
And it's okay. 
Hundreds of millions of years ago, maybe before animals existed, the world was just land and sea. And there were plants on the land - maybe grass, maybe moss. But there had never been a flower. Ever. And then one day, a flower came out.  And then it died. And maybe another long long time went by with no more flowers. And then another one came out. And another. And eventually, there were all different kinds of beautiful flowers appearing all over this planet. Kind, loving, enlightened people are the same. It's the natural course of evolution. 

(This isn't mine, I'm paraphrasing Eckhart Tolle here)
Fred Rogers was a very special man. Introduced to us as young children, his show, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, allowed to enter Fred Rogers's world. It was a world of life, laughter, and love. Mr. Rogers had an immense love for children. What's more is how he appreciated children. His calm demeanour and gentle tone. Never once did we feel talked down to about life. Mr. Rogers treated us as equals. That beautiful, strong, and caring man came to us from Pennsylvania and taught us that simply by caring, we can be good people too. Mr. Rogers isn't just a legendary teacher. He is one of the greatest men who ever lived.
Just read [this article](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/). I know it's long, but it's worth every second you'll spend reading it. I had never watched Mr. Rogers before when I read this article, but even I started crying once the article started explaining how much Mr. Rogers means to Koko the Gorilla.

If you only have a few minutes, watch [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEuEUQIP3Q) of him convincing Congress to fund PBS. He was basically a hero from a Frank Capra movie in real life.
He made a TV show for children. But more importantly, he's the only famous person I know who's always, *always* been kind, calm, and loving. Nobody has ever caught him so much as saying an unkind word about someone, let alone the kind of scandals we expect from our celebrities.
Fred Rodgers was a tv personality from the 50’s till I was a middle aged kid (about early 2000’s) he is one of the many many reasons PBS is and was a thing and shows like Sesame Street were on. He went to congress and made them fund PBS more, and during his speech after getting an Emmy or some big award he made everyone cry with his speech where he simply said they would take some time and have a  moment of silence he’d watch the time and for a few seconds the place was dead quiet till he said time was up. You may see roomers and bs that he was a sniper in Vietnam bam and be tattooed up that’s why he wore the sweaters but neither are true. He was a good caring kind man on screen and off he was always himself and didn’t need to put up an act to seem more appealing. He’s worked with a lot of people from Bill Nye to Michael Keaton. 
In an attempt to give a serious answer to you, Mr Rogers was one of the good ones. He had this way of explaining things in a way that just made sense, and not just to children but to adults.

Even if you disagreed with some specific viewpoint he had, his way of explaining things was such that his passion was clear but that he wasn't belittling anyone else's viewpoint. There was never sarcasm in the way he presented himself. Nor hate or anger.

It is not that he did not have anger. He admits fully that anger is something we all have and deal with. But he never let hate and anger be the drive for his behavior.

Take for instance the divide between those people that like Trump and the people that dislike Trump. They have such a hard time finding common ground because hate towards the opinions of the other side clouds view points. Mr Rogers is the sort of guy that would have been able to talk with people from both sides that were extremely passionate and manage to have the conversation civil.

Not only that, but everyone in the conversation would come away from it better understanding the other side, and being more willing to find a workable compromise.

There is a famous video clip that I'm sure someone has already posted, where Mr Rogers actually goes and talks to congress about funding for public television in a time were congress was gearing up to cut the funding. Here is a group of politicians that are absolutely sure that this is an area where we don't need to be spending money, but he was able to explain to them why public television is so important in such a way that he didn't come off as condescending or anything like that. And he manages to change the politicians mind on things and get the funding.

It's not even a subtle change in mind either. The politician starts off being almost rude to Mr Rogers but by the end it's clear he's entirely convinced.
He had a show on PBS for decades called Mister Roger's Neighborhood. It was an educational show that did a great job of explaining things in a way that little kids could understand while at the same time not sugar coating things or avoiding unpleasant topics. Episodes could be about anything from going to the doctor for a checkup to visiting a factory to explaining divorce or war. He also didn’t play a character in the show, which adds a lot to the appeal since you can tell that he's being his honest genuine self.
Of course we did. We all deserve to be loved, he just made that path easier to see for so many of us.
Actually, he made it his life’s work to help us all believe we not only deserved kindness but could embody it.
Fred Rogers would say that the person we need most of all in this world is *you.*
Because it's Mr. Rogers. And he's pure. 
Mr Dressup was also shown in the US.

Also he was a Presbyterian priest, not one mention of God or trying to sell the Bible... ever.
>Fame is a four letter word. And like tape or zoom, or face or pain or life or love... what ultimately matters is what we do with it. I feel that those of us in TV are chosen to be servants. It doesn't matter what our particular job... we are chosen to help meet the deeper needs of those who watch and listen. Day and night. 

>The conductor of the orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl grew up in a family that had little interest in music. But he often tells people he found his early inspiration from the fine musicians on television.

>Last month a 13 year old boy abducted an 8 year old girl, and when people ask him why... he said he "learned about it on TV." 

>"Something different to try," he said. "Life's cheap, what does it matter?"

>Well life isn't cheap, it's the greatest mystery of any millennium. And TV needs to do all it can to broadcast that. To show and tell what the good in life is all about. But how do we make goodness attractive?

>By doing whatever we can to bring courage to those whose lives move near our own. By treating our neighbor at least as well as we treat ourselves. And allowing that to inform everything that we produce.

>Who in your life has been such a servant to you? Who has helped you love the good that has grown in you? Let's just take 10 seconds to think of some of those people who have loved us and wanted what was best for us in life. Those that have encouraged us to become who we are tonight.

>No matter where they are, either here or in heaven, imagine how pleased those people must be to know that you thought of them right now. We all have only one life to live on earth, and through TV we have the choice of encourage others to demean this life, or to cherish it in creative imaginative ways.

What an absolute legend. I know in those 10 seconds I thought of him.
Alright I’m outta here after this, way to much crying I’m doing in this thread. 
Definitely NSFW in the best of ways possible.
Dude, I'm a mechanic! I say cunt and pretend I don't have feelings 8 hours a day!

How do you expect me to keep my job when I'm crying like a two year old watching this video at my toolbox! 
I love that even Adam Sandler is there in the audience, eyes full of tears. Such a great moment.
His genuine joy and excitement to see him again is truly amazing. Nothing about him was fake or for attention. 
You bet! Have tissues near. 
Great link, my friend!
I mean think about it, your what? 10 years old? Your dad is a massive star and now your being forced to go on his show and have fun when what you really want it do is play with your Legos. Goddamnit look I gotta go around for 8 hours and record me smiling and playing with this goddamn brick, like what's this shit. Goddamnit dad.
I actually have had different exchanges of ways I've attended Sundance through the years. Some from tired attendees that just hand over tickets to see movies (After a few days, seeing movies can be a drain) But I will clue you in a secret: Waitlist. 

If you use the waitlist, you can find where & when the movies are shown. Then, you stand in line, mostly around 80 people that want to get into the Film. For the most part, if you show up about 45 minutes to any showing, you can get in. And it's wonderful! I've seen my last 4 Films that way, with waitlists & patience.

Makes my blood fucking boil. 
FOX news already tries to blame him for millennials being entitled.
I always thought if Jesus showed up in the 60s,  older conservatives would have just called him a dirty hippie and told him to get a job 
You know what, I bet they would do that.  I bet they'd dump all over him, and Mr. Rogers, being the amazing human being he was, would have said, "Well that's alright; everyone has an opinion and their opinion is just as valuable as anyone's.  But I still love them for who they are."

The world is a lesser place with the loss of Mr. Rogers.  I was lucky enough to grow up being able to watch him and learn from him and feel important as a child listening to him talk to me.  I think kids would be a lot better off today if the world had more people like Mr. Rogers to inspire and teach them.  What a beautiful person he was.
My Trump loving mother in law recently made a remark about how he was probably a pedophile and I thought I was going to scream at her.
Please tell me the statue is called Mr. Rawwwwgers
[But NOT this one](https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/10/12/6a/b1/mister-rogers.jpg).
Would that automatically make us a tyranny?
Twitch just started a [marathon of his shows](https://www.twitch.tv/misterrogers).  
He was the first Italian-American ever elected to the Senate, at a time right around the middle of the period depicted in The Godfather; he had a fair amount of bullshit to deal with in his life :-)
Pastore started off kinda brash, but Mr. Rogers had him all warm and fuzzy within about 3-5 words.  The guy has his head in his hand at one point lol

Yeah, I don't blame him for his attitude. He probably gets hundreds of people asking for money for bullshit every single day. I'm glad he was able to able to recognize and honor a genuine request like that. 
Wow, I've never heard this take. That's great to know if that's the actual context! Anyone have a good source?
Things haven't ended. Be him.
When I become a father, I'll make sure I have all episodes of Mister Rogers's Neighborhood so that when I die abruptly, he will fill the void I'd inadvertently leave my kids.
Same 
same here...  100%.

i refuse to repeat the process with my son (nearly 3 years old now).  i don't want him go through life feeling that his father deserves to not breathe.
[deleted]
That's so much better, changing and crediting you!
*Pull over!*
Yeah! Killer boots, man!
Whenever I feel so burdened and so done with the world, I always remind myself to be the person Mister Rogers knew I could be... and to help others remember that, too. :)
Idt I’ve ever seen the trailer for Moon even though I’ve seen it about 10 times.  Sam Rockwell’s best performance imo.
Thanks for the warning, I'll watch it at home alone where no one can watch me cry. 
I'm crying now and I haven't even watched it yet.
It's really powerful stuff, given the mood in the country right now. We need this message so badly.
I was a latchkey kid with serious depression by the age of six. By eight my family life was upended (temporarily) and Mister Rogers was the one thing I could rely on. As often as my dad and grandparents told me it would be okay I just couldn’t believe them. They were as sad and scared as me and it showed.

So every day after school I’d come home and delicately turn the dial of our old television until PBS squelched into view. He was always there. He told me it was okay to be sad, scared, mad, or confused. He never snapped that he didn’t have time to comfort me. He sang to me and made me feel safe. 

In a very real way Mister Rogers quiet and unconditional love for everyone kept me alive in a very dark time. 
I'm atheist, but I still stand by what I said.  I think he embodied the ideals of Jesus' teachings - he lived it and he meant it.
He literally was! He got a masters degree from a seminary and was an ordained Presbyterian minister.
Plus, he did it without talking down to children or being dismissive because they're just kids. He truly wanted kids to understand what was going on. 
Becoming president takes a stupendous amount of ambition. No one this humble and gracious could ever become president.
We don't deserve President Mr. Rogers, but Jimmy Carter was a pretty close imitation.
I don't think one should ever want their idols to become politicians - unless you're prepared to accept they will almost certainly make decisions that will cause you to lose respect for them.

I'd be proud to have Fred Rogers represent my country to the rest of the world.
I thought you were full of it [but nope](https://youtu.be/29lmR_357rA)

You really can't put *anything* past Fox news.

TLDW: Mr. Rogers is an evil man because he taught a generation of kids that they're special. Well in the real world you're not special. We've got such a problem with this entitled generation! Blah blah blah
Oh God, that's Alyson Camerota, current new day anchor, saying that :(

I had forgotten she was part of the Fox news machine at one point. 
You will.  Be someone like him.
My bet is German.
It  isn't that you're not an emotional man; Fred just helps you realize that it's OKAY for a man to be emotional.

At least that's how it is with me. When I'm watching MRN with my daughter, I forget the social stigma regarding my emotional expression as a man. And I weep like a damn baby.
I just spent the past half an hour watching, thanks for that 
Maybe I am. But still, it’s you I like. 
the beautiful thing is, we can all be that man, if we want to be. It's really that simple. 

But as a collective, it's nearly the most impossible thing that will ever be. So as long as our modern day society continues to accept the norm.


they're out there, just not on TV atm.
Every time? I may be remembering wrong
There's a saying that's something like "I want to be the person my dog thinks I am." Fred Rogers was that person.
yes, this exactly
Fuck, that got me
Shit why. Goddamn. Don’t do this to me
Exactly. Mr Rogers never tried to change anyone's attitude. He just treated them with love and kindness, and by his example the change came naturally. Don't worry about the world, just act like Mr Rogers and it will become a better place for you.  That's how we start. 
Whenever I feel so burdened and so done with the world, I always remind myself to be the person Mister Rogers knew I could be... and to help others remember that, too. :)

We can always, always be what he believes we could be. Never give up. Always look for the helpers, and be one, too.
I feel as though as long as you're trying to be the best person you can be and improve yourself daily, he's always going to be proud of you. 
Yes. For me, those periods of time were indisputably worse, despite the fact that we have so much more knowledge of systems of power, corruption, environmental issues today, it was a lot worse to be anyone other than a straight white man and global politics were much more of a mess than they are now.
And can we just add on that in this day and age where we're finding out that a lot of our favorite celebrities are secretly horrible people, that this man died with his legacy completely intact? 

He was every bit as kind and loving as he presented himself to be, and that's a rarity. 
He taught us that everyone is valuable and worth loving. 
He was also a radical Christian who was not afraid to make his opposition to things like the consumption of meat or war known to the public, but without being condescending. Fred Rogers was a very brave man.
This is perfect. If I had to summarize Fred Rogers with two pieces of media, this is it. 
"He was basically a hero from a Frank Capra movie in real life."
Thats perfect
I like how nice to treats children as well. Never talks down to them or really babies them like other kids shows do. 
Please stop, it's raining too much on my face...
So true, Bloody_Shits.
This made me tear up lol darn you!
I heard an interview with him replayed on NPR from the 80's.  They specifically brought that up with him and he said he intentionally never mentioned it because he found the thought of someone feeling excluded for believing something different to be absolutely abhorrent.   
  
The world didn't deserve Fred Rogers.   
He didn't need to do it in his words. He did it in his actions.
You don't need to sell it when you live it. 
TIL. The best ones don't try to sell the bible because they've actually read the bible. 
There's the old story of how a parishioner once asked him for help with his gay son. Fred simply told him "God loves you just the way you are."

Also comforted his gay cast member after discovering he was gay and assured him he thought nothing less of him. (He did initially encourage him to keep it quiet because he feared it would result in Rogers being forced to remove him from the show, but he later stopped that).

I totally would consider Christianity if more pastors were like him. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised to find out Fred Rogers was actually the second coming, but later decided not to make a fuss about it and just focus on making people happy. 
Holy crap. I've never even really watched his show or anything, only know what I know of him from internet references, but that was powerful. 
I can't even count the number of times I've cried to Mister Rogers Neighborhood as a teenager. I grew up watching him but when i would stumble across it on TV as a teenager it his messages always seemed so poignant and were always so spot on with what was going on in my life. That man empathized and loved with all of his being. Such a warm person who really seemed to genuinely care. 
Mr Rogers was our commencement speaker for my college graduation. He did that same 10 seconds of silence bit and I can still remember the absolute stillness of 15,000 people in that arena. Such a powerful presence for such a gentle man.
Jesus... my 38 year old self teared up a bit there. God I miss that man.
how would Mr. Rogers have felt about Black Mirror? 
Yeah, I've got a reputation as a jaded, salty old sailor to maintain and Fred Rogers is just wrecking that today.

I can't wait to see this documentary even if I'm going to bawl through most of it.
I cant be doing this at work. 
**N**eighborly **S**miles and **F**riendly **W**eeping
> 
> How do you expect me to keep my job when I'm crying like a two year old watching this video at my toolbox!

Show everyone else and you won't be alone, they'll understand.
It's so interesting to me how watching old clips of Fred has the same effect on everyone who grew up watching him- tears. We all cry like babies. 

 He was such a good man. He just wanted to help us all realize how special we are in our own way. His demeanor was so comforting. The uncertainty in the world today is scary, I really wish he was here. 
It's funny meeting the children of people who work in the arts. For people on the outside it's this "magical place," but for them it's their parent's job. It's like having a father who is a butcher or a teacher. 
I think the most infuriating part of this is they're saying millenials are entitled because of Mr. Rogers. *Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood* debuted in 1968, and stopped in 2001. These trash commentators would've probably been children at the height of Fred Rogers' popularity. 
Ho. Ly. Shit. Those good for nothing mouth flaps really had nothing better to do besides bash Mr god damn Rogers.

Fox news should be burned to the fucking ground.
I couldn’t finish watching that, but my take away from them is that they want a show that teaches kids that everyone is born worthless until they accomplish something and if you don’t accomplish anything, then you will remain worthless. 
Oh my fucking god they really have no fucking decency do they. I knew they were absolute shit before but I never expected them to go and attack **Mr. FUCKING Rogers.** Fuck Fox News goddamn
Honestly, at the risk of going off topic, this has always been my real problem with Fox. It's not that they're biased,  it's that they're so needlessly aggressive or defensive about the dumbest shit. It's like they want to champion acting and thinking like a dickhead all the time.

Like what other news channel is going to have a 6 minute segment whining about something some celebrity did that they don't agree with, especially when it's Mister fucking Rogers, what's the point. And yet they do this shit all the time, like a couple weeks ago when Laura Ingraham was losing her shit about something Lebron James said about Trump in some ESPN thing no one watched.
They misinterpret what Rogers said. He meant what he said when he says “your special just for being you”, but he never endorsed giving people special treatment. His message was one of individuality and going against the gradient of peer pressure. Not that all kids are special and deserve to be treated special. If someone did misunderstand it as such then they are indeed going to have a hard time in life if they think they deserve anything for “being themselves”. To Mr. rogers being yourself wasn’t special because you deserved anything for it, being special was being yourself because nobody else is you, and you are nobody else.

The fox commentators misread his message, however they are right in saying that IF that was his message it would be detrimental to people’s well-being.
> Makes my blood fucking boil.

This is perfect. The people who classify Mr. Rogers as their enemy identify themselves as the source of the cancer at the heart of our society. They are everything that's wrong with the world, and it swells my heart to see them so shamelessly attack the good in the world, it shows that facts, not confirmation bias, guide my judgment of these individuals.

Fox is hell on Earth, and it is populated by demons.
Hey Fox News: 

“Oh wont you go......   fuckyourself”
I never thought I'd say this but I love those youtube comments.
So what you’re telling me is fox and friends has always been shit?
Legit didn't even have to click on it to know it was fox news, and replies confirmed that.
Jesus Christ. Fuck fox news. One of the nicest people ever on t.v., tells kids to like themselves (success starts with believing in yourself) and fox has a problem with that? Fuck fox news. Fuck cable news in general. All they want to do I sell me shit and con people into voting against their best interest. 
Which is beyond stupid because we didn't even grow up with him. It was still broadcast I'm sure, but even the older millennials were probably more of the Nickelodeon generation.
It would have been a valid response. 
It's actually Fredosaurus Rex.
Yeah we really need to get a replacement. When I first saw that first time I ever went dahntahn I didn’t even recognize it as mr Rogers. 
It's special in its own way, and we should love it the way it is.
Isn't the Senator in the Godfather Part II scene based on him?  They look awfully similar.  
Yeah, that first comment of "Would it make you happy to read it?" comes out just demeaning, but within 3 minutes he's asking genuinely to get a copy of the show. 
Pastore was a man used to getting BS from people and was efficient at turning people le down because of it. I think he was genuinely shocked by Fred’s sincerity and respect.
What, is the Reddit comment section not a good enough source?
No, don't be Mr Rogers - that's impossible. 

but you *can* be the neighbor he'd want you to be. 
We have Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood now.  It's nowhere near what Mr Rogers was, but it's based on his shows and endorsed by his family.  It's the distant second place we have on Amazon streaming that little kids can get started on.
Or when you leave to go get cigarettes. 
These days there’s Daniel Tiger’s neighborhood too, which is very, very similar in content but it’s an animated tiger and his family’s and friends. His parents teach him most of the life lessons, though it also has other important adults fill those teaching roles on occasion. If you prefer, a talking animated tiger can fill the void left by your  death instead of Mr. Rogers.
FYI they are available on amazon prime.  

-current dad.  
Tic tac?
I love crying and there's few things better than crying in public with a group. Being happy in a group happens all the time but to be with a mass of people all feeling the same raw emotion, knowing that you're not alone, that everyone feels bad sometimes, it really connects you to the group on a much deeper level. Spoilers for Toy Story 3, but that movie is a great example. I saw it in the theater and while it's a sad movie, you could tell everyone was keeping it together. Then the scene in the furnace comes on. When Buzz just looks at Woody and give him his hand, one lady a few rows back just gasped and sobbed and let the rest of the theater know it was ok to let go and enjoy the ride. Crying started in every corner of that theater and as we all left with wet faces and red eyes, we looked at each other and just gave the nod, acknowledging that while I don't know you, we're all brothers and sisters.  
But why cry at home?

We like you *just the way you are.*
Well I'm glad to hear it, and I know he would be too. 

How sad it is that we give up on people who are just like us.
This is very touching.  I feel like Mr. Rogers is the human embodiment of a dog.  
I read a comment in a previous thread that mentioned Mr. Rogers, by another Atheist and (paraphrased) it went something like:

> I don't believe in God but if I die and find myself in Heaven, being told by Jesus that he did actually return and his name was Fred Rogers, I wouldn't be surprised. "I came back and told you everything you needed to know, but a lot of people weren't paying attention so I didn't make a big deal out of it". 
To dedicate your life to love, forgiveness, and reconciliation transcends all creeds and borders, it is universal. All we can ever do is try and live up to his example.
Fred be with you.
The man was a minister, so he took Jesus pretty seriously.
Fellow atheist checking in, I recently posted something similar when I was talking about Sir Patrick Stewart as a contrast to him. Fred Rogers is probably the most divine being I have or will ever bear witness to. He is the ideal all men should strive for (in my opinion). 

Second place is Steve Irwin (and I'm not sure if I am joking about that or not).
As someone raised Christian and turned away from Christianity in disgust from the actions of everyday “Christians”, I agree.

I no longer believe in a God or Christ figure, but I still try to emulate many of the things I was taught about Christ.
The world today could use a Fred Rogers more than ever
I'd argue that they COULD become president, but they would never WANT the job in the first place. I believe this is how George Washington approached the job. The country trusted him, but he didn't want that job. He only took it out of loyalty to the newly formed country, and is still remembered as one of the greatest Presidents.
Jimmy Carter did and America hated him
Jimmy Carter isn't all that far off.
He was. I'm conservative and his policies might have been, misguided sometimes. But he was certainly one of the kindest presidents we've ever had. 
They would actually hate Jesus himself if he came back. 
When you’re on the wrong side of Fred Rogers you’re on the wrong side of history.
I remember that and fuck them for this.  
My heart just sunk watching that
>*My* generation is full of hardworking people. I'm worried about the upcoming generation!

No, it's the children who are wrong!
What do I do with the mad that I feel?
As Mister Rogers's mom once taught him, always look for the helpers. They are here, and you can be one, too.
He came in with a spring or fall-weight jacket, took it off, and usually put on a knit sweater jacket or cardigan. Man, I  remember that as a little kid younger than my kids are now. He was around for a long while. 
Not to mention he talked about current events in a way to help kids understand. Like JFK's assassination and Vietnam. More of a way to help them understand what was going on in the world instead of trying to shelter them
The irony of not just admitting you may be crying when talking about a man who made it his mission in life to say it is okay to be emotional and cry.
Mr. Rogers is truly the hero we've always needed but never deserved.
Fred thought we deserved him- a genuine friend that loved us when it seemed no one else did. 
I looked forward to seeing him - he took time to spend with us and made us feel worthy. 
Every time I think about him and what he contributed I'm brought to tears. If we found out that he was Jesus reincarnate, I would not be surprised.
This just made me sad. I don't know why. Maybe because I've never really known anyone personally like him. 
Preach the Gospel, and if necessary use words. -St. Francis of Assisi. 

Profound statement, regardless of your views on Christians, Christianity, and the Church (which, in my view, are NOT at all the same thing).  Live your life in such a way that your words are nearly an unnecessary after thought to your message.
My mom always told us "actions speak louder than words"

And I like "words are wind"


Amen. I'm not a Christian, but one of the people I have the utmost respect for was. My OIC (Officer In Charge) when I was an ATC in Seoul, Korea, was Captain David Baskett, an amazing individual married to an equally amazing woman.

Captain Baskett thought of himself as a "primitive Christian." He was not aligned with any organized church, he was not an evangelist in any contemporary sense, and he never once invoked God or Jesus in conversation, although in our line of work (air traffic control) you sort of hoped they were keeping an eye on things.

He once told me that his version of evangelizing was to live his life as he believed Jesus did, and if someone noticed and asked about his beliefs, then and *only* then would he start to share his personal testimony. He felt it was better to create a place that others wanted to enter into *by their own desire* than to push it at them.

By their deeds you shall know them.

Fred Rogers was so exceptionally rare in that he possessed the ability to speak with pure, simple candor without seeming cheesy or false.  His earnestness and honesty was immediately apparent in every interaction he had.  
  
He was the very definition of a self-actualized person.  What was happening in his heart and in his head, was precisely congruous with what he said and did.  
  
Mr. Rogers was completely authentic, and in a world where it seems as though all of my other heroes have turned out to be liars and hypocrites, I can't tell you how much his authenticity means to me.  
  
I grew up with Mr. Rogers.  I'm a cynic and a pessimist.  I have no religion, and no particular faith in humanity.  But I believe in Mr. Rogers, and I'm proud to consider him my [lifelong friend.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9OqyUuCY0s)  When my kids watch Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, I'm thankful that some of Mr. Roger's legacy has lived on for my children.
  
Also, today is his birthday March 20, 1928.
Do yourself a huge favor and watch some episodes. It's not a "kids show" in the stupid, vapid, brainless way we now shove media at children to keep them quiet or push products.

It doesn't talk-down to kids or treat them as too dumb to handle hard questions and issues. Even adults can learn from its lessons in mindfulness and compassion. 

It's powerful and touching and amazing in a way no show has managed to capture since. I should take my own advice and watch it again.

Everything he does is powerful.    
Like, sucker-punch you right in the emotions powerful.   
  
It hit Netflix a year or so back and my kids refused to watch it. I put it on anyway. They screamed - it's old and boring and they want to watch paw patrol and bla bla bla.... all through the opening credits and sequence they just bitched and moaned.

Mr. Rogers opened his mouth and started talking and both my kids shut up immediately. Stood in place slack-jawed mid-fight, as if they were frozen solid. They sat down and watched the entire episode. Not a damn peep from them the entire time.

That man was some kind of special.

I read an article about this clip once that made me appreciate it one even more than the other clip. When he first asks audience to take 10 seconds to think the people who made who we are, you can hear people giggle, like "oh what a cute thing for a children's show host to do." But then they realize "oh wait, he's dead serious," and everyone gets really quiet and teary eyed. He literally puts Hollywood in their place with just his calm confident presence. 
I certainly don't wanna speak for such a wonderful man, but it seems to be like when he advocated for quality educational children's programming he speaks to how they need it to help proper development.

Black Mirror is a quality show examining thrilling subject matter, but there's no doubt it's for adults to consume. I like to think there's room in this world for both Mister Rogers and Black Mirror, as long as there's a clear distinction between the two, lest children improperly attach thoughts and feelings to the mature themes in the latter programming that adults can easily avoid and/or deal with. 
Agreed. 

Years ago my kids started watching something. I wasn't paying attention, but something perked my ears. I knew that song. I recognized the names. I couldn't be, could it? 

Daniel Tiger. 

I was excited about this and we definitely watched it. 
I did not order this box of friendly, smiling onions.
Oh for sure, I'm actually in Pittsburgh. Mr. Rogers might as well be a god here, and for good reason! 
In the documentary, he says the reason he started the TV show was because he saw a TV show that consisted of people throwing pies in each others faces. He thought it was so rude and ugly.  So he set out to make a show that was the complete opposite. Sadly not much has changed with TV today. Remember when the History, TLC, A&E channel’s used to be about learning?
>The children now love luxury; they have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise. Children are now tyrants, not the servants of their households. They no longer rise when elders enter the room. They contradict their parents, chatter before company, gobble up dainties at the table, cross their legs, and tyrannize their teachers.

I know it isn't a socrates quote by merely a paraphrase of a quote caricaturing socrates but this bitching about younger generations isn't even new. 
Anything to not take blame for THEIR fucking parenting that developed this supposed "narcissism". 

Were we shitty parents? No, it was Mr. Rogers that was wrong! 

Fuck them all. 

They aren’t blaming millennials. 

Look at the average viewers age and consider how old this clip is. They’re talking about Gen-X, my generation. 

The millennial generation gets lumped into the entitlement labels because baby boomers were able to provide for us and millennials’ parents. Apparently having parents raise kids in proper homes with access to basic human rights and services for all is enough to be labeled as being “entitled”. 

Fuck Fox News. 
It's just a completely ridiculous "study". I'm 32 and towards the high side of the millennial age and I didn't really watch him growing up. I knew about him, but my friends and I were all about Nickelodeon. Gen X certainly would've been more influenced by Mister Rogers.
If any children's TV show taught millennials to be entitled, it would be thanks to that little shit Caillou.
God damnit, I can't believe I wasted time to look these people up but your point is spot-on. The only exception is Steve Doocy, who was 12 at the time of the debut so he was probably too old to care. I get the sense that these people came from money and didn't grow up like 90% of us. They probably wondered "Why is he talking to the mailman? They're like the help, you don't converse with them." At this point I am totally projecting since that clip was so infuriating. They might as well be slapping my dead mother in the face for how they are treating such a powerful influence on why I'm 1/2 the man I am today. /rant

> Instead of saying, "you're special, you're great?" Why not say, "hey there is room for improvement."

It's a children's show.....

I really hope those hosts don't reproduce
It's just fucking pathetic. 
Fox news needs to just die off
As opposed to Fox News who makes everyone paranoid and pissed off. Fuck those mouth breathers. Mr Rogers told everyone to try hard too. Gonna mention that? Nope. In pure typical Fox style. Complete PoS news.
I would feel bad if Fox News was burned to the ground over a difference of political opinion.

I would help you light the torch if they were burned to the ground for dissing Fred Rogers.
I don’t think Mr. Rogers would want anything burned to the ground. I don’t think he would support violence in any capacity— even if they are spreading propaganda. Who knows what genius thing he would come up with to counteract it, but it would probably involve quietly speaking about proving them wrong with actions, not arguments. Then he would hug them and tell them he liked them just they way that they are. Then tell them a story about how he once met a handicapped boy who would self-harm and scream about how he wanted to die. And Mr. Rogers asked him to pray for him, because he believes that people who suffer a lot in their lives are closer to God. So the boy stopped trying to hurt himself and instead began praying for Mr. Rogers— because everyone had always prayed for *him*, and he never considered he was someone who could pray for someone else. 

Mr. Rogers stood for love. He did not fight against hate, he just didn’t leave any room for it. 

“Being able to resolve conflicts peacefully is one of the greatest strengths we can give our children.” -Fred Rogers

You've just described Conservatism and why it's a cancer to society.
They didn't misinterpret it, they just don't understand that there's a difference between going against the gradient of peer pressure and expecting special treatment. They think those two things are the same thing.
I grew up with him before getting cable when I was around 10. I'm 26 now and know plenty of others who watched him, sometimes even still when we need some wholesome reminders
I get to walk by him every day! What you don't see is Trolly riding up his tail on his back. He's currently outside of [2100 Wharton Street](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.4298846,-79.97611,3a,58.2y,71.24h,94.3t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srLsIyDC3pg1loZDj14M7mA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en&authuser=0) in Pittsburgh's South Side Flats. They usually come by in mid spring to give him a mani-pedi. I think a lot of kids like to stand on his feet because those are the first parts to start looking rough, but I'm sure the winter sidewalk treatments don't help.
That statue is beautiful and unique in it's own way. Love it for what it is, not what we want it to be.
The Senator in Godfather II is Irish-American. He's also a slimy corrupt anti-Italian bigot. I don't think the character is based on Mr. Pastore.
Pastore is the path Michael would have taken if he hadn't chosen to meet and kill Sollozzo and Mckluskey. 

>I never wanted this for you. I work my whole life - I don't apologize - to take care of my family, and I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots. I don't apologize - that's my life - but I thought that, that when it was your time, that you would be the one to hold the string. Senator Corleone; Governor Corleone. Well, it wasn't enough time, Michael. It wasn't enough time.
I don’t think he meant it to be demeaning. They had already listened a bit to Mr Rogers before this and was basically on his side for the most part. I think genuinely wanted to let him talk as much as he wanted.
I take everything I read in the comment section as 100 percent accurate. I’m doing this wrong?
Believe in the Mr. Rogers that believes in you.
Be the Mr. Rodgers you want to see in the world 
On Prime video they have 7 seasons of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood. It is my daughters favorite show. It really is timeless. 
Not only is he an animated tiger, he's the son of Daniel Striped Tiger from the original show.
Same thing happened recently in Coco. I love watching movies that make me feel. 
I saw Schindler’s List in the theater on opening day. I’d heard the general details of what it was about, but not much else - I’m a huge Spielberg fan and a lover of docudramas, so it was on my list to see for those reasons alone. The effect the film had on the audience was profound, myself included. When the lights came up we all sat there for a long moment in silence and looked around at each other. Not a dry eye. I think it’s safe to say everyone left feeling absolutely exhausted from the emotional rollercoaster, but with a renewed sense of humanity. 
It was a really rough time and I don’t hold any animosity toward my dad and grandparents. 

Mom went into rehab. Dad was... totally unprepared to be a temporarily single dad. My grandparents were from another time when you didn’t admit anything was wrong. You smiled and carried on. 

My brother was easier. He was older and knew the basics. He also didn’t have depression and anxiety problems. He's also a boy. Dad knew how to handle a boy. You throw camouflage clothes on him and tell him to go do boy stuff with his friends.

I was bookish, introverted, and sad. It was frustrating for a man who was trying to work, help us with school, and keep his own mental shit in order while worrying about mom. 
One of the central themes of Christianity is that as followers, we should strive to be as much like Christ as possible. Fred Rogers just did a better job of that than most.
I would be surprised by the existence of the afterlife and Heaven and Jesus and all that... but *given* the existence of those things, I *wouldn't* be surprised by the Mr. Rogers revelation. "Oh, okay. *That* at least makes sense."
Oh God you’re gonna make me cry
The best part about Mister Rodgers is even if you didn't always live up to his example he would still like you for being you, and you could tell he meant that when he said it.  

And also with you. Amen.
And Rogers with you.
Our neighbor who arts in heaven, hallow be thy name
Something about "Loving your neighbour."

Funny how some see this as a weakness but I wish I could be half the man that Fred Rogers was.
I love that he never pushed that, and just made the the message the headline.
He was a minister but he never preached religion. He preached kindness and love and caring, which is supposed to be common to every religion. He never even mentioned Christianity or any other religion, on purpose. 
fred rogers, steve irwin, bob ross

holy wholesome trinity
Steve is animal Jesus. Fred is for humans.
Also an atheist- I couldn’t agree with this more. I recently cried about Steve Irwin too when I saw a passionate interview with his daughter Bindi. 

Such incredible men, such impactful shows, I cherish both deeply. ❤️
I don't think that thought of Steve is a joke. Some people just have pure souls who truly understand how to live. They've figured out the meaning of life... and Steve was one of them.

Good point. Obvious extenuating circumstances re Washington but he's the best counterpoint.
To be fair, America hated the 1970s recession and 1979 energy crisis which happened to coincide with his presidency. 
I'm also a conservative and I give Carter credit for 2 things: 
1. Though they all claimed to be Christian, Carter walked the walk as a follower of Christ more than any other president. 
2. [Carter gave us Paul Volcker as Fed chair, hurting the economy (and his reelection chances) a bit in the short term in order to massively help the economy in the medium to long term. Even Ron Paul gives him credit for that.](http://fortune.com/2015/10/31/paul-volcker-jimmy-carter-donald-trump/)

Freaking crazy arab carpenter hanging out with immigrants and social outcasts saying we should "love" each other. Can you believe he says the rich should give their hard earned dollars to the poor! We need to show these snowflakes that that's not how the real world works!
A middle easter man who taught lessons about the dangers of materialism and spread a message of pacifism and forgiving your enemies.

They'd call him an anti-troop communist hippie. 
I can't believe that if [a Jew who wanted to help the poor and gave out free health care](https://i.imgur.com/0Xqo5ls.jpg) came along, that Fox would have anything bad to say about him...
They much prefer [Supply Side Jesus](http://www.beliefnet.com/news/2003/09/the-gospel-of-supply-side-jesus.aspx)
Absolutely. The conservative bible is actually "Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rynd. The KJ bible is totally irrelevant. 
Didnt his mother hand knit every sweater he put on? 
And he changed his shoes, in time with the melody of the song. 
Our children deserve him and people like him in thier lives. 
Dude! No!

He’s the Friend we deserve! He told us that himself. We should feel like we deserve such an amazing person as our hero, as our friend - that’s what he wanted for us.
> the hero we've always needed but never deserved.

The best thing about Fred Rogers is that he would totally disagree and state that everyone deserved that kind of love.
That's the thing about compassion. It's not given because people deserve it, it's given because they need it.
Wow, that's an amazing quote, and it's sad that I don't remember hearing it before.
So does George RR Martin 
That was something a few teachers I remember said to me in Catholic school, that the best way to be a missionary in your everyday life was not to talk about Jesus, but to do best you can to live the way he taught you to live, which means showing kindness and love to all, and that is what will bring people in. But don't live that way because converting people is the goal, live that way as a personal choice as part of your relationship with God, and everything else will fall into place on its own

He also helped [saved the VCR](http://mentalfloss.com/article/29686/how-mister-rogers-saved-vcr).
I think this is one of the most powerful ones to me. I first saw this on Reddit a few years ago and this made me respect him even more. It's honestly one of the most impactful speeches I've seen.
I'm not crying, you're crying. 
I'm with you 100% down to the kids and Daniel Tiger.  I had to show my 10 year old a few Mr. Roger's Neighborhood episodes after seeing Daniel Tiger.

Even though they have the same core values, there was just something about the authenticity of Mr. Roger's that can't be captured anywhere else, certainly not in an animated show.  He had a kitchen.  He had a fish tank.  He had a mailman and neighbors and a plant to water.  He was just a regular guy.  And that trolley...oh my god that magical wonderful trolley that would disappear into that tunnel and venture into the world of make believe....


Yeah, I'm too jaded to live the life of him. I would want to be like him, but I couldn't without feeling like a fraud. 

I'm just glad the world got to experience him. 
The Mr. Rogers episode and Sesame Street episodes on dealing with death are probably the most powerful episodes of any show ever, not just kids shows.
I never realized why I talk to kids in a normal tone but it was from watching him all those years
Greetings from a fellow Pittsburgher!  I remember getting to tour the set when I was a kid.  I loved Mr. Rogers growing up!
From Pittsburgh here as well. I always say the most important statue in the city is the one to commemorate Mr. Rogers. 
[deleted]
It makes me so upset to see what has happened to educational television. I grew up on that. When I was 12 I watched a 4 hour documetary on Rome on history channel and I loved it. Wound up researching Roman history at the library and just soaked it up. I loved learning about animals by watching animal planet (big cat diary and anything with Steve Irwin were my favorites). I would watch documentary after documentary. Now it's mostly junk on the discovery network, so I have to go find documentaries online. Natgeowild, natgeo, pbs, bbc america, and smithsonian are my favorite channels now. It's a shame that I have to swap between so many channels though to get what I used to get on just three. I rarely watch animal planet, history, or discovery anymore and they were always my go-to channels growing up.
Yeah not like those 70's rockers who respected their parents and authority!
I know I do it now. It’s a realization I’m getting old. Youths!!!!

Wait 
> cross their legs

That was a negative thing?
:3 it's even better because by blaming Mr. Rodgers they're still saying "I was a shitty parent because I did not monitor what my child was watching."
> baby boomers were able to provide for us and millennials’ parents

baby boomers are millennials parents
Yeah, there are *so* many stories out there about how Fred Rodgers just telling kids they were special made a difference in the lives of kids that felt alone and unloved. The reason he was so revolutionary is literally because he saw that kids are humans too, and they can feel like they have made mistakes in life even at a young age, and sometimes just need to be told that regardless of anything in their lives, someone loves them.
Mr Rogers would love them just the way they are. 
That will only happen when their core audience of 70+ die off. It's happening tho. I live in Texas and only 1 person in my entire 100+ employee office has any support for them or the GOP(I just lump them together since they're on the same team), he always changes the break room tv to Fox and we always change it back to whatever random Dr. Phil episode is on the next channel over.
Fox is anger pornography for old men who can't get excited any other way.
There's a huge difference between having a different political opinion, and willfully spreading propaganda that you know is false.
Basically mr rogers saying everyone is special for being themselves instead of saying "you have to do something with yourself and become a billionaire to be special" ruined millennials because it makes them think that they are important as individuals. 
Hello fellow yinzer. Thanks for pointing out where this is. I know Pittsburgh loves its dressed-up dinos but didn't know we had one of Mr. Rogers.

Ever go visit that big statue of him down by the river? Even as an adult I feel the need to sit on it and pretend I was a kid again, when I believed people like him were actually running things.

Guess we just gotta be our own Mr. Rogers these days, for ourselves and the ones we care about.
This guy Rogers. 
[Yep](https://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/getty_033117_cristianorenaldoairportbust.jpeg)
Sorry I don’t mean the one they frame with the dead hooker. The one only seen at the hearing. Looks just like this guy in the real Senate. 
It was kind of demeaning, and it was meant to be a sharp "get to the point Mr Rodgers".

There is a great video that breaks down this conversation and how Mr Rodgers appeals to the elephant i.e. the opinion being held and not the rider i.e. Mr Pastore.

Found it - 23 minutes but well worth the watch if you want to take a moment and learn about how you can change someone's mind with just a bit of understanding.

Yours is the sweater that will pierce the heavens.
Who do you think you are, neighbor?
I went into Coco thinking it was a sub-par Pixar movie because I hadn't been paying attention to box office or reviews... I cried, my wife cried, my 3-year-old son cried too... because we told him there was going to be zombies in it and "they weren't zombies! they were just stupid skeletons!!!".
I missed out on Coco in the theaters. I feel like Pixar is great for those kinds of movies... Coco, Toy Story 3, Up, Inside Out...
Inside Out, too.
Well obviously we now need to start a *new* religion based on Fred Rogers, and the premise that Jesus Christ came back under a different name, and the whole world had its collective head shoved so far up its own ass that we didn't even realize it. 
That makes two of us :(
None of that "And with your spirit" crap in the Church of Rogers.
I'm pretty sure that, while Douglas Adams absolutely deserves credit, this fact of civics was stated in The Federalist papers as well as indirectly referenced even so far back as Plutarch's *Lives.*

It's just one of those unfortunate realities of humanity.
They also hated things he said like "please don't waste gas" and "put on a sweater"

America was like, "FUCK YOU I'M GETTING NAKED, CRANKING UP THE HEAT AND USING GAS TO WASH MY DOG"
If you're looking for reasons to love Carter, he was also the one that deregulated craft brewing and home brewing.  We would not have had the beer renaissance that we have now without Carter standing up to the big beer companies.

https://www.kegworks.com/blog/how-jimmy-carter-sparked-the-craft-beer-revolution/
Sadly accurate 
A lot of people confuse him with the very similar looking [Supply-Side Jesus.](https://imgur.com/gallery/bCqRp) 
Sometimes.

He had a few episodes that brought out the fact that everyone makes mistakes, and there was one where he buttons his sweater wrong, which threw off the timing. That was the point. "it's ok to make mistakes, as long as you do your best".

Edit: Daniel Tiger delves into this too. "🎶 It's ok to make mistakes. Try to fix the and learn from them, too! 🎶 "

The words a person with borderline personality disorder most hears in their head: “I don’t deserve.”

Diagnosed with BPD, I can attest that if I had that man in my childhood, I wouldn’t have the same symptoms I have today.  To love and be loved. - “and I’ll be back” - these are such important messages that often do not come across to our children.

**Our  children need and deserve Fred Rogers and his messages** . I think we need to accept that, especially for their mental health in a world where parents don’t often have time for their children.  Isn’t that the message he was trying to get across?
Because he liked us, just the way we are. Gonna go cry some more, now.
He was an amazing person. Shame he died so young. Here are the words he was listening to as he died, per his request:

"I cry aloud to the Lord;

    I lift up my voice to the Lord for mercy.

I pour out before him my complaint;

    before him I tell my trouble.

When my spirit grows faint within me,

    it is you who watch over my way.

In the path where I walk

    people have hidden a snare for me.



Look and see, there is no one at my right hand;

    no one is concerned for me.

I have no refuge;

    no one cares for my life.

I cry to you, Lord;

    I say, “You are my refuge,

    my portion in the land of the living.”

Listen to my cry,

    for I am in desperate need;

rescue me from those who pursue me,

    for they are too strong for me.
Set me free from my prison,

    that I may praise your name.

Then the righteous will gather about me

    because of your goodness to me.”


I've been trying to implement that philosophy but with my political beliefs. Be the type of person that those who believe the opposite of you want to get to know you better and understand you more. Then and only then will their misconceptions begin to change. And perhaps more importantly, misconceptions of my own that I didn't know I held will change as well. 
Damnit I don't even open it and I'm tearing up at my desk.  I got to meet him when I was a kid.  What a great person he was.
It's such an epic moment, the type of turnaround you only see in fiction.  The man was an absolute legend.
Me too neighbor, me too.
Damn, Edward Norton needs to play him in a biopic.
You have just been you and that is just perfectly fine. Don't think of yourself any less by comparing yourself to this man. But if you want to pass on Mr Rogers word in the future that would be great too.

Be the kind of person Mr Rogers knew we can be.
Gaius Julius Caesar once stood at a statue of Alexander the Great and lamented that by his age Alexander had conquered the world, but Gaius had done nothing of note with his life. 

Don't compare yourself to others, it's a fruitless journey without end because there are an endless number of people who are better at any number of things than you are.


> I had to show my 10 year old a few Mr. Roger's Neighborhood episodes after seeing Daniel Tiger.

I did this recently with my 5 year old.  He was fascinated by it:  "Wait.  So that's Daniel's dad?"  
  
And it was interesting to see that he was perfectly engaged by watching Fred talk, show him the contents of a box, feed the fish and demonstrate some toys.  He really liked it when Mr. McFeely came.
  
Kids are kids, man.
He's not someone you copy. He's someone you draw inspiration from. Try your hardest to be the person that Mr. Rogers knew you could be. 
> Sesame Street episode

He has a very soothing voice to listen to. I like to play episodes of his show and Bob Ross to my son for some calm tv time :) 
Also from Pittsburgh! I remember when he died and it wrecked me
I was being a bit hyperbolic just to fit the "mechanic" stereotype. Yeah I do swear in the right company but even that company is a great group of guys who really look out for each other.

In fact after I posted that another tech came over to show me something and I said "Oh I'm just crying over here watching some Mr. Rogers thing." and he just said "Nope! I ain't crying today!" and turned around lol
"No but that was just the fringe of society"
I forgot what it was exactly but some Fox News talking heads set up where this woman had been saying the standard "kids these days are entitled and lazy and they all have safe spaces and are special snowflakes" and the other person said something along the lines of well wouldn't that at least create better behaved people. And this woman was like "Pfft in my day we had sex, drugs, and rock and roll and that built character."

It's not like this generational warfare is about the specifics, it's about more tribalism and another place to put faith in the us vs them mentality. That is what is forever about the cycle.
Hell, I was taught that saying "she" is impolite. 

Times change. 
I made the television be the parent because I was too busy/shitty and now I don't like how my spawn turned out. 
I have two very religious grandparents but they are as liberal as they come. Contradicts the generalization of Fox News viewers (not that I don’t agree with it). I guess it helps my pap was a union steelworker his entire life and hardworking. 
He's the Rogers we need right now, but not the one we deserve.

I saw Coco in theaters two days after my Grandmother had passed away. It killed me watching that movie, but it was such a cathartic experience. 

In comparison to your "sub-par" feeling though, I felt a little bit of disdain for Coco when I went to see it because I was in love with the Book of Life. It felt like a stab in the back having both movies with similar plots by competitive studios. Seeing Coco when I did just made me love both of the movies so much more.
Anyone that doesn't cry in the first 15 minutes of Up is someone I do not need in my life.
I hate you all.. I'm not crying!, your Crying...

Excuse me for a minute. I totally wont be crying over in the corner. 
Well, it's been "and with your spirit" since at least the early 2000s in Spanish.
Hell, it's a central issue in Plato's *Republic* as well.
It’s really weird how most of the USA went from the pull together attitude of WWII to the FU attitude we had shortly thereafter.

The worst part is i had to make a professional call over a medical appt. Saw the vid linked and still watched it, knowing i would end up crying and would be all sniffles on the phone call. Still did it. no regrets. I embrace my humanity. Mr. Rogers was a gorram Saint.

I showed my 6 year old niece an episode, but I was worried that she'd think it was boring, and she didn't seem very excited about it, but the next time I saw her, she wanted to watch another one. 
Yes!  Kids have not changed.  It is the adults and the world who keep changing. 
It was actually done in one take because the actors we're too emotionaly exausted for another
What is this water coming from my eyes?
What the fuck are you supposed to say instead of she?
my grandmother passed on this past dia de los muertos (we're mexican american) so i  avoided the movie until two weeks ago, you're right it was totally cathartic to watch especially since i really dislike to cry in front of my family so i hadn't really cried about the death. 
Whenever I feel so burdened and so done with the world, I always remind myself to be the person Mister Rogers knew I could be... and to help others remember that, too.
Just a shame its raining.
You can thank the Baby Boomers for that. Their parents handed them the world on a silver platter and they pissed and whined it wasn't enough and have been tantruming ever since.
The transition from Greatest Generation to boomers.
I was six, I cried, he still hugged me and calmed me down.  I don't remember much it would've been '86 or early ' 87, but I have a picture of me and him with me holding my trolley
Yep.  They'd worked with the actor for 14 years.
You say the person's name. 

"What is she up to nowadays?" vs "What is samantha up to nowadays"

I had like 6 years of etiquette classes in addition to what I learned at home. It's all inefficient garbage for the most part. 
You also had the ones who had mean sons-a-bitches for fathers, coming back from WWII all shellshocked and pissed off. They went the other way with the *'Hell No We Won't Go'* crowd, and now they mostly linger in parks in San Francisco.
Goddamn what a legend that man was.
Can you please post that pic somehow? I’d love to see that. And a bit more context if you don’t mind? 
Did that also apply to "he", or was it only unacceptable when talking about women?
