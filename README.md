  Predicting opening stock prices after clinical trial news. 
  </h3>
  
<p>
  I created and currently am working on a model for looking at stock prices after clinical trial announcements. <a href="https://github.com/jhj2/Self-Projects/blob/master/BiotechModel/BiotechModelWriteup.md" title="Read more here."> Read more here.</a> <b> Update: </b> Added code for using the model in real time. Effectiveness of model has not been determined due to volatility from COVID-19.

  TJ Warren: Good at floaters, not much else
  </h3>

<p>
 
  TJ Warren is one of the best players at shooting at <1 ft away from the basket. However, low assist totals and poorer shooting farther away from the basket prevent him getting more playing time.  <a href="https://github.com/jhj2/Self-Projects/blob/master/BasketballAnalysis/TJWarren.md" title="Read more here">Read more here.</a> <b> 2020 update: </b> TJ Warren has found a home in Indiana, leading the team in total points scored and a top-3 shooting percentage on the team. However, most advanced stats (e.g. VORP, win-shares) do not rate TJ as highly as other teammates.

  Basketball player similarity profiles
  </h3>
 
 <p>
  I created a workflow for picking a basketball player and generating profiles of similar players and what their production looks like. Examples of images down below.  <a href="https://github.com/jhj2/Self-Projects/blob/master/BasketballAnalysis/SimilarityProfiles.md" title="Read more here."> Read more here </a>

  Building a box office predictor based on trailer reactions
  </h3>
  
<p>
  How good is using the comments section of Reddit posts to predict the opening weekend gross of a movie? Turns out that it does a decent job but could use more information to better build the model. <a href="https://github.com/jhj2/Self-Projects/blob/master/BoxOfficePredictor/BoxOfficePredictor.md" title="Read more here"> Read more here </a>
